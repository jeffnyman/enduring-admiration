amphictyony (am-fic-tee-o-knee)
The amphictyony hypothesis proposed that pre-monarchic ancient Israel was organized as a league of twelve tribes around a central sanctuary, similar to ancient Greek religious leagues called amphictyonies.


Noth (1960) said this: "Es geht nicht darum, ob wir externe Evidenz brauchen, sondern ob wir sie haben." Translated, this is: "The question is not whether we need external evidence, but whether we have it."

"The effectiveness of [Noth's] creativity was enhanced by his formidable ability to reconstruct and coherently describe whatever he perceived as historically plausible. With impressive erudition, he was able to lead his reader through the many implications of his historical decisions. It was in reading Noth that I first became aware of the _hubris_ intrinsic to the role of the historian of ancient Israel, who almost singlehandedly is capable of creating the past" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 83-4).

"[Noth] ever preferred logic and necessity to evidence" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 85).

Noth felt that archaeology had provided no evidence at all for the historicity of the biblical narrative that could be relied upon. Thus, "by pointing out first the reality of the archaeological situation, he was proposing that we make a virtue out of necessity and proceed to write history without evidence" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 85).

"[Noth] was also suggesting that critical historical work, in its search for evidential support for its historiography, be abandoned" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 86).

"Ever a logician and theologian, Noth sought truth through reason and the euphoria of conviction. He had no qualms about following the principle that if an element within his reconstructed historiographical world were necessary, then it had to have existed. As evidence was of its very nature circumstantial — and ancient evidence both circumstantial and arbitrarily accidental — it could play only a minor role in Noth's rationalistic history. When the need for it surfaced — that is, when a theory reached an impasse and analogies seemed too distant for convincing confirmation, implying a need for very specific historical realities as yet unknown — Noth, like any good metaphysician, made them up. He invented what he needed" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 86).

This is what led Noth to "a cornucopia of historical events refracted from that mother of all fictions, the Deuteronomistic History" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 86).

"The plausibility Noth demanded was complex. He well understood that the appropriate context for a critical historical perspective could not simply be the imagined-to-be-real world of the text's composition. Unfortunately, far too often Noth took this hard won axiom of Wellhausen's day, and through a logical inversion, derived his context from his text, thereby creating a history of which we have no knowledge whatever" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 86-7).

"Having cited the criteria, Noth proceeded rather to determine and delineate as history the unknown on the basis of the even less known, in the certain confidence that, having stated his principles, none would notice that he did not follow them" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 87).

"But much more important than creating for us the means of answering our questions, tradition history has supplied our field with the possibility of infinite variations of tradition history" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 88).

"What kind of a history do we have here that is neither cumulative nor progressively clarifying? What kind of evidence are we dealing with that changes with every practitioner? What kind of integrity adheres to discussions we call critical, when our conclusions carry no more conviction than the recognition of another variant's plausibility?" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 88).

"who today has the _hubris_ to move from story to historical reality without some very serious consultation about the degree of refraction that exists between our context and its text?" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 89).

"Noth himself, in the excessive rationalism of his methodology, almost singlehandedly destroyed — and the ÜS was his primary tool — the historical goals with which Alt had inspired his students" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 89).

"Much good research has been lost to what has become the anti-historical pseudo-discipline we call tradition history — that mythical realm where not only does history take on meaning, but where events happen and contexts occur wherever and whenever a rational person needs them" (Thompson, 1994, pp. 89-90).
