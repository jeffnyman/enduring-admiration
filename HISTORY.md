Detienne (2000) speaks of "the past, the ways of speaking of it, of thinking of it, of constructing it, and the difficulties in doing so" (p. 176).

Detienne (2000) has a valuable idea buried in dense prose. Here's the quote:

> "Let us agree on this immediately: anyone intending to engage in a comparative analysis of systems of historicity implicitly rejects all those who would accept, to whatever extent, on no matter how small a scale, the evidence of an initial division between societies endowed with a 'historical consciousness' and societies devoid of it. As much as it seems impossible to distance ourselves from our own historiographical system, to that extent it seems to us urgent to analyse its components, to be suspicious of its apparent uniformity and to question its presuppositions, so as to observe as clearly as we can the details in the consciousness of itself adopted by any society, through its construction of time or perception of the past." (p. 174).

Detienne is making two main points:

First point: If you want to compare how different societies understand and relate to their own history, you have to reject the old assumption that some societies are "historical" (they care about and record their past) while others are "ahistorical" (they supposedly live in a timeless, unchanging world). This assumption was common in earlier anthropology and colonial-era thinking. That assumption wrapped around the idea that "primitive" societies didn't have historical consciousness like "advanced" ones did.

Second point: Even though it's really hard to step outside our own way of thinking about history (our "historiographical system"), we need to try. We should:

- Break down what assumptions we're bringing to the table.
- Not assume our way of thinking about history is the only way.
- Look carefully at how every society constructs its relationship to time and the past.

Essentially, Detienne is saying: "Don't assume Western historical thinking is the norm and everyone else is deficient. Instead, recognize that all societies have ways of understanding their past; they're just different systems. And to see those differences clearly, we need to examine our own biases first."

Detienne later says we must "understand the double meaning of 'historical': on the one hand, belonging to natural time just like all living things; or on the other hand, being aware that the human race, in its present state, possesses a history and that it makes it or at least works as hard at it as it can" (p. 175)

The "double meaning" Detienne identifies is:

- Historical as temporal existence: Everything that exists in time has a "history" in the basic sense: things change, events happen, time passes. Rocks have geological history, species have evolutionary history, etc.

- Historical as conscious agency: The awareness that humans have a history and actively make it: the sense that we're not just swept along by time but are conscious participants shaping our collective story.

Claude Lévi-Strauss famously distinguished between "hot" societies (historical, changing, self-consciously progressive) and "cold" societies (trying to maintain stability and continuity). But this distinction has been heavily criticized for implying that some societies lack historical consciousness. Given that Detienne opens by rejecting divisions between societies "with" and "without" historical consciousness, I read this reference as him setting up Lévi-Strauss's framework in order to complicate or move beyond it. He's probably saying: "Yes, Lévi-Strauss gave us this distinction, but now we need to think more carefully about what 'making history' means in different cultural contexts."

Detienne has yet another dense pargraph that starts with ""It is not necessary to be a historian of history ..." Let's work through this because Detienne is making a few interconnected points here.

- Point 1: Even in the West, learning to think of the past as truly separate from the present (as "something else" rather than just an extension of now) was a long, difficult development. This wasn't natural or automatic.

- Point 2: Similarly, the "objective" way we measure time (clocks, calendars, precise dating based on astronomy and mathematics) is a relatively recent invention, even in Western culture. Ancient peoples didn't have our scientific framework for time.

- Point 3 (the key claim): Here's where it gets interesting. Detienne is arguing that a society doesn't need any of these specific Western features to be considered "historical":

It doesn't need linear time (as opposed to cyclical)
It doesn't need to emphasize unique, unrepeatable events
It doesn't need to see human actions as driving historical change

In other words, he's saying: "Look, even we in the West took forever to develop these supposedly 'obvious' ways of thinking about history. So why would we use our particular historical consciousness as the measuring stick for whether other societies are historical at all?" He's undermining the criteria that Western scholars have traditionally used to judge whether non-Western societies "have history."

Detienne gets to his methodological framework, the core concept of which is "systems of historicity," which he's borrowing from Hartog and Lenclud. I'm not directly familiar with the specific 1992 paper by Hartog and Lenclud - "'Regimes d'historicite, modeles de temporalite'" - especially if it was unpublished or had limited circulation at the time Detienne was writing.

However, I am familiar with François Hartog's broader work, particularly his concept of "regimes of historicity" which he developed more fully in later publications (especially his 2003 book Régimes d'historicité: Présentisme et expériences du temps). Hartog's idea is that different societies and different historical periods organize the relationship between past, present, and future in distinctive ways - these are the "regimes of historicity." For example, a "heroic" regime might look to the past as a model for the present. A "modern" regime might emphasize progress toward the future. A "presentist" regime (which Hartog argues characterizes our contemporary moment) focuses overwhelmingly on the present. It sounds like Gérard Lenclud (an anthropologist) was working on similar conceptual territory, likely from his anthropological perspective.

Detienne refers to a specific quote from that unpublished paper:

> to take up, in a comparative way in the field of anthropology ... the various forms of historical awareness, of a semantic experience of history, of a conceptual construction of human time, without for all that postulating besides its necessary coherence, nor, as a result, making the assumption of a close correlation between a culture and a historical system.

What this tells us is that the term "systems of historicity" is doing a lot of work. It's a way to study how different cultures relate to history without imposing Western assumptions. The key advantages of this approach (from the Hartog/Lenclud quote):

- Comparative anthropology: You can compare different cultures' "historical awareness" on their own terms - their "semantic experience of history" (how they talk about and conceptualize it) and their "conceptual construction of human time" (how they organize and think about temporal experience).

- No assumption of internal coherence: A culture's system of historicity doesn't have to be perfectly consistent or unified. There can be contradictions, competing ideas, different practices in different contexts.

- No tight culture-history correlation: This is crucial - you don't have to assume that a culture = one fixed historical system. A single culture might have multiple, even conflicting ways of relating to its past. And similar historical systems might appear in very different cultures.

What this means practically is that instead of asking "Does Society X have historical consciousness?" (yes/no), you ask "What is Society X's system of historicity? What are its components? How do they conceptualize human time?" You're studying the variety of historical consciousness, not measuring cultures against a single standard.

Detienne draws on Augustine's famous meditation on time to show how a particular Western conception of historical consciousness was constructed. Let's unpack Augustine's three "presents" as Detienne describes them:

- Present of past things (memory): The past doesn't really "exist" anymore except as it's present now in our memory. When we remember, we're experiencing the past in the present.

- Present of future things (expectation/waiting): Similarly, the future doesn't exist yet, but it's present now in our anticipation, our sense of what's coming.

- Present-present (immediate experience): The actual "now" moment in its punctuality - the fleeting instant.

Why does this matter for Detienne's argument? Augustine locates all three temporal modes in the soul - time becomes internalized, psychological, experiential. And crucially, the soul experiences this as "distension" (distentio) - a kind of stretching or tension. The self is pulled between memory, anticipation, and the instant. This creates what Detienne calls "that distance of self to self" - a split or gap within human consciousness itself. We're simultaneously here-now, remembering-then, and anticipating-later.

The payoff: This Augustinian framework becomes foundational for Western ideas of history because it makes time a human, subjective construction happening within consciousness. It's a very specific way of spatializing and internalizing temporality.

Detienne asks: "How does one begin to think like a historian? A double foundation: distance of self from self, critical space within a culture" (p. 178).

Detienne is suggesting that Western historical thinking - "thinking like a historian" in the specific Western sense - requires these two foundations:

- "Distance of self from self": This is exactly what he just described through Augustine! The internal split in consciousness where you can stand apart from your immediate experience, hold past-present-future in tension, and reflect on your own temporality. You need this psychological "space" to conceive of yourself as existing in history rather than just being.

- "Critical space within a culture": This extends the Augustinian interior distance outward to the social level. A culture needs the ability to stand back from itself, to create distance between "how things are now" and "how things were/could be." This critical distance allows for questioning, comparing different moments, recognizing change.

Detienne is showing how these two "foundations" are specific to Western historiography, not universal requirements for historical consciousness. He's essentially saying: "Look, here's how we learned to 'think like historians' - through this Augustinian interiority and cultural self-critique. But this is our system of historicity, not the definition of historical thinking." It fits perfectly with his larger argument: don't mistake the Western model for the only way to have historical consciousness. Other cultures might construct their relationship to time and past very differently, without needing this particular kind of "distance."

Detienne says that we can extend that hypothesis in a direction by saying that " besides the distance of self to self, the advent of critical space, would a decisive element in the collective life not be 'a great and long experience of changes'? Experience, and, perhaps, an awareness of changes?" (p. 178-9).

He's proposing that alongside the psychological ("distance of self to self") and cultural ("critical space") dimensions, there might be a third crucial element: "A great and long experience of changes" - and perhaps more importantly, awareness of those changes. This is a really interesting addition because it suggests that Western historiography might have emerged not just from philosophical/theological reflection (Augustine) or cultural self-critique, but from lived experience of significant, sustained transformation.

The implications: If a society experiences dramatic, repeated changes - political upheavals, technological shifts, cultural transformations - and becomes conscious of that changeability, it might develop a particular sensitivity to history as a process of transformation. The past becomes genuinely different from the present in a felt, undeniable way. This could help explain why linear, progressive, or developmental models of history emerged in the West - societies that experienced (and conceptualized) rapid change might naturally develop historical frameworks that emphasize transformation over continuity. But notice: Detienne phrases this carefully as a hypothesis ("would...not be?"). He's exploring what made the Western system tick, not claiming this is necessary for all historical consciousness. Other societies might emphasize continuity, cyclical patterns, or other temporal frameworks based on their collective experiences.

Detienne: "The religious memory of Israel, emphasized by the 'remember', formed by the 'remember the privileged relationship to Yahweh', can certainly amass genealogies, lineal descendance and compare among them the great ancestral models, Jacob and Abraham. This memory does not lead immediately to the institution of a historiographical discourse whose object would be the past in itself" (p. 178).

Now Detienne is giving a concrete example of a different system of historicity - Israel's religious memory - that doesn't fit the Western historiographical model he's been describing. What Israel's memory system does:

- Centers on the imperative to "remember" (zakhor)
- Maintains a covenantal relationship with Yahweh through memory
- Accumulates genealogies and lineages
- Compares and reflects on ancestral models (the patriarchs)

What it doesn't do (according to Detienne) is create "historiographical discourse whose object would be the past in itself" - meaning, it doesn't treat the past as an autonomous object of inquiry separated from present religious commitment.

The key distinction here is that Israel's memory is fundamentally relational and covenantal rather than critical and distanced. The "remember" isn't about establishing what objectively happened in a detached way; it's about maintaining fidelity to Yahweh through the act of remembering. The past isn't "the past in itself" - it's the past as it bears on our relationship with God now.

This is actually a different "system of historicity" - one organized around religious obligation and communal identity rather than critical distance from self and culture.

Thucydides represents a distinctively Greek approach to history where the historian's goal is to uncover human nature through studying patterns of change, conflict, and upheaval. The idea is that human nature reveals itself most clearly in crises - revolutions, wars, times of turmoil and extreme passions. This is phusis anthrōpōn (human nature) and metabolai tōn xyntychion (changes/revolutions of circumstances/situations). he contrast with Israel's memory is that this is really different from the covenantal memory system! Thucydides is looking for:

- Universal patterns in human behavior
- What stays constant across changing circumstances
- Lessons that future generations can apply because human nature doesn't change

He's creating a kind of "possession for all time" (as he famously says) - a resource for understanding any future conflict because the underlying dynamics are repeatable.

Why this matters for the balance is that we have three different systems of historicity:

- Augustinian/Western: Critical distance, self-reflection, developmental time
- Israelite: Covenantal memory, "remember," relational past
- Thucydidean/Greek: Analytical inquiry into patterns, human nature through crisis

Each has different purposes, different relationships to "truth," different ideas about what the past is _for_.

Detienne then brings this around, I think, when he says this: "When the contemporary historian refers to change as the indelible mark of history, he understands it in its relation to absolute chronology, to linear and irreversible time as well as to the unpredictable, singular and purely contingent event. Event, change and time are closely linked up in our thinking as historians" (p. 180).

Detienne is circling back to make explicit what's been implicit throughout his argument. What he's saying is that when we (modern Western historians) talk about "change" as the essence of history, we're actually invoking a whole package of assumptions:

- Absolute chronology: Objective, measurable time sequences
- Linear and irreversible time: Time moves in one direction, you can't go back
- The unpredictable, singular, contingent event: Things happen that are unique, unrepeatable, not predetermined

These three elements - event, change, and time - form an interconnected system in modern Western historiography. They define what we think history is. The critical insight here is that by pointing out how "closely linked up" these are "in our thinking as historians," Detienne is emphasizing that this is our particular configuration - not a universal or natural way to understand the past.

- Thucydides had change and events, but was looking for repeatable patterns, not singular contingency
- Israel had events and time, but organized around covenantal memory, not linear irreversibility
- Other cultures might emphasize continuity over change, cyclical over linear time, typical over singular events

Whawt this means to me is that when you're examining Old Testament historicity, you have to be aware that you're bringing this modern "event-change-time" framework to texts created within a different system of historicity. The question becomes: how do you honor both systems without collapsing one into the other?
