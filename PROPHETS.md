[IMPORTANT] Albertz says "the Deuteronomistic historians shared the prophetic concept that Yhwh governed the course of history by his word, mostly revealed to the prophets" (2012, p. 345).

Walter Dietrich, in his 1972 Prophetie und Geschichte: Eine redaktionsgeschichtliche Untersuchung zum deuteronomistischen Geschichtswerk says:

> [Die] Geschichte ist für ihn nichts anderes gewesen als das Wirkungsfeld zukunftsmächtigen Prophetenwortes. Kein Ereignis . . . tritt aufgrund irgendwelcher außenpolitischer, soziologischer, personal bedingter oder ähnlicher Konstellationen dieser Art ein, sondern weil Jahwe es durch einen Propheten hat ankündigen und festmachen lassen. Israel wird vom Prophetenwort zu den Meilensteinen seiner Geschichte getrieben.

> History, for him, was nothing other than the sphere of influence of the prophetic word, which had a powerful future. No event occurs due to any foreign policy, sociological, personal, or similar constellations of this kind, but because Yahweh had it announced and confirmed through a prophet. Israel is driven by the prophetic word to the milestones of its history.

Albertz says "the Deuteronomistic historians share a basic prophetic concept" (2012, p. 345).

Albertz says that "three Deuteronomistic editions of prophetical books could be reconstructed and identified during the last decades" (2012, p. 343). He refers to the following:

- the Deuteronomistic Book of Jeremiah (JerD)
- the "Book of the Four" (Hosea, Amos, Micah, Zephaniah)
- the "Book of the Two" (Haggai, Zechariah)

If we assume this is true, that would mean Deuteronomistic editors had a heavy amount of interest in the literary heritage of the prophets. Ten male and two female of these prophets by name: the prophets Samuel (1 Sam 3:20), Gad (22:5), Nathan (2 Sam 7:2), Shemaiah (1 Kgs 12:22), Ahijah the Shilonite (11:29), Jehu (16:1), Elijah (21:17), Elisha (2 Kgs 9:1), Jona (14:25), and Isaiah (19:2); and the prophetesses Deborah (Judg 4:4) and Huldah (2 Kgs 22:14).

Some scholars purport that only certain prophetic elements were part of prophetical narratives in the DH:

- the Naboth story (1 Kgs 21)
- the Ahasiah story (1 Kgs 1)
- the story about the Jehu-revolution (2 Kgs 9–10)
- the narratives on Samuel (1 Sam 1–3; 7–15)
- the narratives on Nathan (2 Sam 12; 1 Kgs 1)
- some of Isaiah's resistance in the Assyrian crisis (2 Kgs 18–20)
- - the narrative originally comprised 2 Kgs 18:9–19:7, 32aβ–34, 8–9a, 36aβ–37
- - 2 Kgs 20:12–19 constitutes an epilogue to it.

Other elements are claimed to be "post-Deuteronomistic":

- the drought composition around Elijah (1 Kgs 17–18)
- the narrative on Elijah at Mount Horeb (19)
- the collection of war stories in which different prophets are acting:
- - 1 Kgs 20:1–43; 22:1–38; 2 Kgs 3:4–17; 6:24–7:20

Some feel that the entire "Elisha Biography" (2 Kgs 2–8; 13:14–21), although of older origin, was not included in the Deuteronomistic History before the postexilic period.
