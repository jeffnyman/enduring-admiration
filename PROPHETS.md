The terms `nby'` and `nb'` refer to the basic root words in Hebrew that are used to form the concepts of "prophet" and "to prophesy."

The Noun: *nby'* (נָבִיא)

This is the root for the noun *nāḇî'*, which means "prophet" (singular). Auld notes that the origin and earlier biblical sense of this word (*nāḇî'*) are unclear. Scholars debate where this title came from and precisely what it implied about the person in the earliest texts.

The Verbal Themes: *nb'* (נבא)

This is the root for the verb meaning "to prophesy" or "to act as a prophet." This root appears in two main verbal themes (or stems):

- **Niphal (hit-pael):** Often used for "to prophesy." This is a reflexive/passive stem. It suggests the action is either done to oneself (like allowing oneself to be seized by the prophetic spirit) or is a state of being.
- **Hithpael (hit-pael):** Also used for "to prophesy." This is a reciprocal/reflexive stem.

Auld points out two related disputes:

- The relationship between the noun (*nby'*/prophet) and the verb (*nb'*/to prophesy) is disputed. Does the person get the name *nāḇî'* because they *nb'* (prophesy), or is the verb *nb'* derived from the noun's meaning?
- Whether there is a distinction in sense between the two main verbal themes (the Niphal and the Hithpael forms) when they are used to mean "to prophesy." Do they mean the same thing, or does one emphasize being called/moved by God while the other emphasizes the act of speaking?

So, to summarize some of this:

- **nby'** refers to the noun *prophet* (*nāḇî'*).
- **nb'** refers to the verb *to prophesy* (*nāḇā'* in various forms).

Auld's statement reflects an ongoing, high-level scholarly discussion about the etymology (word origin) and function of prophecy. Scholars try to connect the Hebrew term to possible origins in other ancient Semitic languages (like Akkadian *nabū*—"to call") or Egyptian. The debate isn't just about language; it has profound implications for understanding the nature of the prophetic experience and divine communication in the Hebrew Bible.

The terms Auld uses are conventions in Hebrew linguistic scholarship (known as lexicography and philology) to refer to the basic root letters for "prophet" and "to prophesy." Here is the breakdown of the terms and the specific disputes Auld mentions.

Hebrew Roots: $nby'$ and $nb'$

In Hebrew, words are built around a three-consonant root (or trilateral root). Vowels are added to this root to form different parts of speech, like nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Auld is using a scholarly shorthand for these roots.

### 1. The Noun: $nby'$ (**נָבִיא** *nāḇî'*)

* **Refers to:** The **noun** meaning **"prophet"** (the person). The 'y' often represents the vowel sound *î* or *ê* associated with this form, specifically the final letter.
* **The Dispute (Origin):** Auld is pointing out that the **etymology** (the historical origin of the word) is highly debated.
    * **Common Theory:** Most scholars link it to the Akkadian root *nabû*, meaning **"to call"** or **"to name/proclaim."** This would imply the *nāḇî'* is "**one who is called**" or "**one who calls out/proclaims**," often understood in the passive sense as "one who has been called by God." This aligns well with your **Thomist** leanings, as it frames the prophet's role as dependent on an exterior divine call (grace).
    * **Alternative Theories:** Other proposals connect it to Egyptian or another Semitic root that implies **ecstasy** or **bubbling up/raving**, especially because early prophecy (like in 1 Samuel) often involved ecstatic groups.

### 2. The Verbal Themes: $nb'$ (**נבא** *nāḇā'*)

* **Refers to:** The **verb** meaning **"to prophesy"** (the action). The final letter here (a *’aleph*, usually represented by the prime or apostrophe) is the third consonant of the root.

* **The Dispute (Relationship):**
    * **Relationship to the Noun:** Scholars debate whether the noun (*nāḇî’*, prophet) comes from the verb (*nāḇā’*, to prophesy), or if the verb is a **denominative** verb—meaning the verb was *created from* the noun. In other words, did the "prophet" (the title) precede the "prophesying" (the action), or vice versa? The current consensus often leans toward the verb being denominative, derived from the title *nāḇî'*.

* **The Dispute (Verbal Themes/Stems):** The core of Auld's second point is that Hebrew verbs change form (called **stems** or **themes**) to indicate voice, intensity, or kind of action. The verb *nāḇā'* appears in two main stems for prophesying:
    * **Niphal (N-stem):** Typically passive or reflexive.
    * **Hithpael (HtD-stem):** Typically reflexive or reciprocal, often suggesting ecstatic or repeated action.
    * **The Question:** Is there a difference in meaning between, say, a prophetic action expressed in the Niphal versus the Hithpael? Scholars once thought the Hithpael specifically denoted **ecstatic** prophesying (like raving), while the Niphal was for more **controlled** prophetic speech. However, modern scholarship often finds that the biblical evidence for such a neat distinction is inconsistent, leading to Auld's observation that the distinction in sense is "equally disputed." The debate reflects a larger question: Is prophecy primarily an ecstatic, Spirit-moved event, or is it a deliberate, sober proclamation of a divine message?

This highlights a key challenge in biblical studies: drawing clear lines between the technical linguistic data and the real-world, religious function of the words in their original context.

[IMPORTANT] Albertz says "the Deuteronomistic historians shared the prophetic concept that Yhwh governed the course of history by his word, mostly revealed to the prophets" (2012, p. 345).

Walter Dietrich, in his 1972 Prophetie und Geschichte: Eine redaktionsgeschichtliche Untersuchung zum deuteronomistischen Geschichtswerk says:

> [Die] Geschichte ist für ihn nichts anderes gewesen als das Wirkungsfeld zukunftsmächtigen Prophetenwortes. Kein Ereignis . . . tritt aufgrund irgendwelcher außenpolitischer, soziologischer, personal bedingter oder ähnlicher Konstellationen dieser Art ein, sondern weil Jahwe es durch einen Propheten hat ankündigen und festmachen lassen. Israel wird vom Prophetenwort zu den Meilensteinen seiner Geschichte getrieben.

> History, for him, was nothing other than the sphere of influence of the prophetic word, which had a powerful future. No event occurs due to any foreign policy, sociological, personal, or similar constellations of this kind, but because Yahweh had it announced and confirmed through a prophet. Israel is driven by the prophetic word to the milestones of its history.

Albertz says "the Deuteronomistic historians share a basic prophetic concept" (2012, p. 345).

Albertz says that "three Deuteronomistic editions of prophetical books could be reconstructed and identified during the last decades" (2012, p. 343). He refers to the following:

- the Deuteronomistic Book of Jeremiah (JerD)
- the "Book of the Four" (Hosea, Amos, Micah, Zephaniah)
- the "Book of the Two" (Haggai, Zechariah)

If we assume this is true, that would mean Deuteronomistic editors had a heavy amount of interest in the literary heritage of the prophets. Ten male and two female of these prophets by name: the prophets Samuel (1 Sam 3:20), Gad (22:5), Nathan (2 Sam 7:2), Shemaiah (1 Kgs 12:22), Ahijah the Shilonite (11:29), Jehu (16:1), Elijah (21:17), Elisha (2 Kgs 9:1), Jona (14:25), and Isaiah (19:2); and the prophetesses Deborah (Judg 4:4) and Huldah (2 Kgs 22:14).

Some scholars purport that only certain prophetic elements were part of prophetical narratives in the DH:

- the Naboth story (1 Kgs 21)
- the Ahasiah story (1 Kgs 1)
- the story about the Jehu-revolution (2 Kgs 9–10)
- the narratives on Samuel (1 Sam 1–3; 7–15)
- the narratives on Nathan (2 Sam 12; 1 Kgs 1)
- some of Isaiah's resistance in the Assyrian crisis (2 Kgs 18–20)
- - the narrative originally comprised 2 Kgs 18:9–19:7, 32aβ–34, 8–9a, 36aβ–37
- - 2 Kgs 20:12–19 constitutes an epilogue to it.

Other elements are claimed to be "post-Deuteronomistic":

- the drought composition around Elijah (1 Kgs 17–18)
- the narrative on Elijah at Mount Horeb (19)
- the collection of war stories in which different prophets are acting:
- - 1 Kgs 20:1–43; 22:1–38; 2 Kgs 3:4–17; 6:24–7:20

Some feel that the entire "Elisha Biography" (2 Kgs 2–8; 13:14–21), although of older origin, was not included in the Deuteronomistic History before the postexilic period.
