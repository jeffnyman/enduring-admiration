      <h1>The Early Trail of Gaming</h1>

      <p>
        The game I'll focus on for this article is one of the most well-known games within an educational context. Much like the lunar landers I talk about in another article, <em>The Oregon Trail</em> evolved through a series of variants that threaded their way through the early evolution of gaming, showing yet another way programmers could combine ludic and narrative aspects.

      <h2>The Context</h2>

      <p>
        The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of April 1965 authorized the establishment of regional facilities to address educational problems and issues. The act didn't define specific regions; thus, the individual states had to define regions and instigate planning and development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, in 1965, the University of Minnesota College of Education formed the Central Minnesota Educational Research and Development Council (cmERDC). The focus was to provide technology support and volume purchasing services to eighty Central Minnesota school districts.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1966, the cmERDC formed a larger computing consortium, much like the BOCES system in New York that I talked about in the context of <em>The Sumerian Game</em>. The cmERDC proposed that Minneapolis-St. Paul school districts join forces to purchase a time-sharing mainframe and introduce terminals at schools throughout the Twin Cities.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        For non-American readers, the term "Twin Cities" (capitalized) in the context of the United States usually refers to Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota. Both cities are close, separated by the Mississippi River. The distance between them is roughly ten miles (sixteen kilometers).
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1967, this initiative led to the creation of the Minnesota School Districts Data Processing Joint Board, soon renamed Total Information for Educational Systems (TIES), encompassing eighteen area school districts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The objectives of TIES were to develop a cooperative educational data processing system for the Twin Cities metropolitan area, establish a data processing staff devoted to the needs of elementary and secondary education, and expand the use of the computer as an educational tool. Along with this, TIES had goals of making new resources and instructional techniques available to school personnel, providing better dissemination of information among schools, and developing a means of exchanging student information.

        The People's Computer Company newsletter published an <a href="../assets/docs/oregon/PCC-v1-n3-Feb-1973-TIES-Info.pdf" data-size="835 KB">article about TIES</a> in its February 1973 issue.
