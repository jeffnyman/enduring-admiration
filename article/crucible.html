      <h1>Computing and Crucible Eras</h1>

      <p>
        This article focuses not on any specific games but on the broader historical context in which games and gaming came to be situated in a technology context, specifically that of computing.

      <h2>A Basis in Experimentation ...</h2>

      <p>
        Exploring the early days of computing and game development is like peering into the Wild West of technology. In the nascent stages, hobbyists &mdash; armed with programming languages like BASIC &mdash; were similar to pioneers in uncharted territory. These early game developers weren't just coding; they were conducting experiments, pushing the limits of the available technology to see what it could do.

      <p>
        It was a fusion of creativity and curiosity, where every line of code was a step into the unknown. Much like scientists in a lab, these early hobbyists were learning by doing, discovering the capabilities and constraints of the hardware and the software they could run on it as they went along.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, these games weren't just entertainment; they were manifestations of the evolving relationship between humans and machines, each line of code a small triumph in the ongoing saga of technological discovery. It was a time when the boundaries of possibility were drawn by the imaginations of those who cared enough or were interested enough to experiment with the digital frontier.
      </p>

      <h2>... But a Focus on Computation</h2>

      <p>
        Arguably, <em>computer</em> science should have been called <em>computing</em> science. Or, there should have been a shift to that terminology as the technology evolved beyond the hardware itself and into what the software running on that hardware actually did.

      <p>
        When I say "computation," please understand that this isn't just about the mechanics of programming or coding. It's about computational design, the latest incarnation of which engineers create in artificial intelligence applications.
      </p>

      <p class="popout">
        As a matter of interest, artificial intelligence grew up with the idea of technology-based gaming and continues to be used in that context today.
