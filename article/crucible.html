      <h1>Computing and Crucible Eras</h1>

      <p>
        This article focuses not on any specific games but on the broader historical context in which games and gaming came to be situated in a technology context, specifically that of computing.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>A Basis in Experimentation ...</h2>

      <p>
        Exploring the early days of computing and game development is like peering into the Wild West of technology. In the nascent stages, hobbyists &mdash; armed with programming languages like BASIC &mdash; were similar to pioneers in uncharted territory. These early game developers weren't just coding; they were conducting experiments, pushing the limits of the available technology to see what it could do.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a fusion of creativity and curiosity, where every line of code was a step into the unknown. Much like scientists in a lab, these early hobbyists were learning by doing, discovering the capabilities and constraints of the hardware and the software they could run on it as they went along.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, these games weren't just entertainment; they were manifestations of the evolving relationship between humans and machines, each line of code a small triumph in the ongoing saga of technological discovery. It was a time when the boundaries of possibility were drawn by the imaginations of those who cared enough or were interested enough to experiment with the digital frontier.
      </p>

      <h2>... But a Focus on Computation</h2>

      <p>
        Arguably, <em>computer</em> science should have been called <em>computing</em> science. Or, there should have been a shift to that terminology as the technology evolved beyond the hardware itself and into what the software running on that hardware actually did.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/crucible/computation.jpg" width="570" height="391" alt="Stylized visual of the idea of computation.">

      <p>
        When I say "computation," please understand that this isn't just about the mechanics of programming or coding. It's about computational design, the latest incarnation of which engineers create in artificial intelligence applications.
      </p>

      <p class="popout">
        As a matter of interest, artificial intelligence grew up with the idea of technology-based gaming and continues to be used in that context today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Computation has always been, and still is, what transforms the design of our products and services. The history of design in this context has always been an exciting interplay of various dynamics. These dynamics have engineers considering which problems require solutions from a design perspective, which users are prioritized in the design process, and what considerations are given to other technological systems. Eventually, this morphed into looking at who holds the authority to establish technical and economic priorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, these are fundamentally social considerations that intricately mold the trajectory of technological development. In essence, the evolution of technology is a dynamic interplay between technical functionalities and the social forces that navigate the complex terrain of problem-solving, user needs, and overarching societal priorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those considerations mean that computational design is the intersection of humans and technology, an area that has always fascinated me. Design has always determined how humanizing or dehumanizing that intersection is. One of the ways that computing has always been most humanized was when it focused on simulations and games.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of those early simulations and games began in the context of education &mdash; around what I'm calling "people's computing" &mdash; and then became more democratized and, eventually, commercialized. Thus, the human-technology intersection and the societal impact became profoundly more significant.
      </p>

      <h2>Historical Computing</h2>

      <p>
        The history of computing captivates with its intriguing landscape, beckoning researchers to employ a myriad of theoretical and historiographical frameworks adeptly. This inherent diversity fascinates and enriches the subject, intricately weaving through crucial historical developments from the late nineteenth to the twentieth centuries. It embraces technical, social, economic, and political facets, forming a tapestry of interconnected elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Computing is a subject of paramount significance for specialists in the history of technology and for a myriad of scholars across diverse disciplines.
      </p>

      <p class="gutter">
        Computing involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, designing efficient algorithms, and implementing systematic solutions. This approach, essentially a computational mindset, resonates across disciplines. Thus, computing provides a structured and analytical approach that transcends the boundaries of traditional computer science, making it a powerful tool for problem-solving and knowledge advancement in various areas of study.
      </p>

      <p>
        The richness of the history of computing extends its relevance not only to social and cultural historians but also to sociologists of professions. This breadth of scope underscores its role as a focal point for interdisciplinary exploration, drawing scholars from various fields to unravel the multifaceted tapestry of its evolution and impact on the broader historical landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        That may all sound very academic, but there's a specific reason for my assertion. Recent scholarship in the history of technology has revealed a profound and enduring insight: intricate social processes play an equally influential role and actively shape technological change beyond the influence of inherent technological imperatives. This realization challenges the notion of a singular, ideal trajectory for technological evolution. Instead, technologies emerge as solutions crafted to solve specific problems and tailored to particular users within distinct temporal and spatial contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This insight means that our technology and computation have an inherently interesting intersection with humans and, arguably, even what it means to <em>be</em> human. It is particularly fascinating when you consider how much of this history began.
