      <h1>A Ludic Historian Précis</h1>

      <p>
        As we delve into the Ludic Historian series, I'll ask you to prepare to transcend the constraints of a traditional chronological account. I want to embark with you on a nuanced exploration where the concepts of ludology (game-playing) and narratology (story-telling) will take center stage.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Ludic Experience</h2>

      <p>
        This isn't going to be merely a journey through time; it's going to be an odyssey through the intertwined realms of gameplay and storytelling. That intertwining is critical. Nicholas Ware wrote an article called "A Whirl of Warriors: Character and Competition in Street Fighter" in which he said:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Many discussions in game studies have centered on binaries. In the 1990s, much was made of the real vs. the virtual. In the oughts, narratology vs. ludology. The solution to both these so-called arguments was transforming the "vs." into an "and," as it will likely be with any binary introduced into game studies.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        When you approach the dynamic realm of gaming experiences as a historian, you do often find yourself transcending the traditional narrative/gameplay divide. Instead of confining discussions to the limitations of "narrative" and "gameplay," you find yourself embracing the broader concept of the "gaming experience."
      </p>

      <p>
        The earlier distinction served its purpose in the nascent stages of game studies, establishing boundaries in uncharted territories. However, as game studies has matured, it's time to move beyond divisive debates and recognize the richness that comes from a more inclusive perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my Ludic Historian context, however, I'm going to frame the overall "gaming experience" as the "ludic experience."
      </p>

      <p>
        In embracing the expansive concept of the "ludic experience," I acknowledge a shift from the conventional terms of "narrative" and "gameplay." However, it's crucial to underline that within the realm of the "ludic experience," the art of storytelling retains its profound significance.
      </p>

      <p>
        By adopting the term "ludic experience," I'm not discarding narrative; rather, I'm broadening the perspective to encapsulate the immersive and interconnected tapestry of gameplay and narrative elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a final point, I'll say that in the tapestry of ludic experiences, I'll draw parallels to the cinematic. I do this because I firmly believe that the interactive nature of games weaves a narrative thread similar to the immersive journey found in movies. So, as you buckle up for a distinctive approach to history &mdash; one that unfolds through the dynamic interplay of rules, narratives, and the captivating world of play &mdash; this précis will help set the stage.
      </p>

      <h2>Starting a Ludic History</h2>

      <p>
        Starting a ludic history requires me to consider both the terms "ludic" and "history." In short, my focus on being a Ludic Historian is going to be about looking at the history of games and, within that broad context, a focus on computer games in particular and, even more particularly, on video games. That's simple enough but let's dig down a little deeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Delving deeper into the realm of a ludic history involves more than just exploring the evolution of games; it's a journey into the very essence of human interaction, creativity, and technological advancement. In this series, while there's certainly a focus on the more culturally relevant video games, I will try to unravel the intricate tapestry of play, from ancient games etched into the sands of time to the pixelated landscapes of modern video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm taking this approach because I truly believe that this is a journey that transcends mere entertainment, weaving together threads of culture, psychology, and innovation. As we navigate the labyrinth of what I call Ludic History, I want to examine the societal shifts reflected in game design, the technological leaps that propelled gaming into new areas of interaction, and the intangible yet profound impact of games on the human experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every game &mdash; every ludic experience &mdash; is a portal to a chapter in the vast book of human playfulness.
      </p>

      <h2>The Focus on Ludic</h2>

      <p>
        The term <em>ludic</em> derives from <em>ludus</em>, meaning "play." This is a term that's useful in connection with games and, more broadly, rules of play.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><em>ludic</em></strong><br>
          <em>adjective</em><br>
          of, relating to, or characterized by play.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><em>ludically</em></strong><br>
          <em>adverb</em><br>
          in a ludic or playful manner.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the realm of game studies, the term "ludic" serves as a kind of gateway, guiding us into a fascinating exploration of interactive experiences. This broad field encompasses the analytical approaches of ludology and narratology that I already mentioned.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/precis/game-studies.jpg" width="456" height="197" alt="Game Studies - Narratology vs. Ludology.">

      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, while some discussions might paint ludology against narratology as opposing forces, a more nuanced perspective reveals their symbiotic relationship. Ludology and narratology, far from being competitors, are integral partners in our quest to understand the intricate tapestry of gaming experiences.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ludology</strong> immerses us in the very essence of gameplay &mdash; the design, mechanics, and dynamics that shape the interactive experience. It delves into how a game functions <em>as a game</em> and the profound impact the resulting gameplay has on players.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Narratology</strong> ventures into the narrative structures of experiences, unraveling the stories woven into mediums like films and video games and examining how these structures influence their intended audience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Together, ludology and narratology form a harmonious alliance, enriching our comprehension of games by providing a comprehensive view that transcends artificial divisions. In embracing both, we unlock a more profound understanding of how gameplay and narrative converge to create vibrant and multifaceted ludic experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Studies</h2>

      <p>
        Since I've mentioned game studies let's align on that term. Game studies is a multidisciplinary field that explores various aspects of games, including their design, development, cultural impact, and player experiences.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/precis/gaming.jpg" width="670" height="554" alt="Gaming as a field of study.">

      <p>
        As a discipline, game studies involves analyzing games from different perspectives, such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, and history. It's like examining a complex tapestry where each thread represents a different aspect of games and gaming culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond this, the expansive realm of game studies also extends its gaze to platform studies. This perspective goes beyond the screen, delving into the hardware and software that form the foundation of gaming experiences. It's a holistic examination that considers not only how games are played but also the platforms that host these immersive adventures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through all of these fields of study, there's an intriguing intersection where the art of storytelling intertwines with the dynamic world of ludic experiences. As we embark on this historical journey, I want to help you unravel the threads that led to the ever-increasing sophistication of narratives within the gaming realm. As we look into the evolution of storytelling in games, we're going to find that this evolution was predicated upon the ability to immerse us in the experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Ambient Heuristics</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond the concepts of ludology and narratology, and speaking to that immersion in experiences, as part of my research I want to provide a ludic historian's view of what I'm calling <em>ambient heuristics</em>.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/precis/ludic-blurb.jpg" width="505" height="265" alt="Ludic Historian - Ambient Heuristics">

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ambient:</strong> an aspect of the environment that completely surrounds you
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heuristic:</strong> enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This framing device, for whatever reason, just popped into my head as I was doing research. I think the reason for this is because in ludic experiences there's a unique fusion of challenge and reward, a dynamic interplay between skill and chance that keeps us coming back for more. It's the promise of exploration, the thrill of overcoming obstacles, and the satisfaction of achieving goals that creates a gravitational pull.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the context of ludic experiences, we become active participants, co-authors of stories unfolding in real-time. It's a testament to the power of play to not only entertain but to ensnare our curiosity, sparking a journey where the boundaries between reality and the game can blur, and the joy of the ludic experience becomes a timeless, immersive (ambient) adventure where we always discover for ourselves (heuristics) new ways of being, thinking and doing.
