      <h1>PCC and People's Computing</h1>

      <p>
        Following on from the <a href="./medicine-show.html">medicine shows and Portola</a>, let's talk about the People's Computer Company and, by necessity, the accompanying People's Computer Company newsletter, founded in October 1972 by Albrecht. There is a distinction, and Albrecht gives us some ideas from <a href="https://hclemuseum.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/interview-with-bob-albrecht-by-jon-cappetta-2/">Jon Cappetta's interview with Bob Albrecht in 2015</a> (<a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/bob-albrecht-interview-by-jon-cappetta.pdf" data-sizes="582 KB">PDF version</a>).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        So that was the beginning of PCC, the newspaper, the periodical. Then Dennis [Allison] and I, LeRoy, and some others decided to start a non-profit corporation called People's Computer Company. Now we had PCC the periodical, and PCC the non-profit educational corporation.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Bob Albrecht worked with LeRoy Finkel to create a new periodical within the context of their DYMAX group. They called the group that produced this periodical the <strong>People's Computer Company</strong>. This name was apparently in the same spirit as "Big Brother and the Holding Company'' which was a popular band that formed in San Francisco in 1965. They were most certainly not a company. The "holding" part was a bit of a pun regarding the possession of illegal drugs.

        Let's consider how the newsletter branded itself in the latter part of 1972.

      <p>
        Throughout the newsletters, you will see mention of the EduSystem, as in the image above. The EduSystems were "educational computer systems" made by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Engineers built these systems around the PDP-8 and PDP-11 minicomputers. You would see references in the literature to Edu 5, Edu 10, Edu 20, and so forth.
