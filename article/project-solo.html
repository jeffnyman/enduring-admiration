      <h1>A Solo Approach to People's Computing</h1>

      <p>
        An initiative called Project Solo (sometimes written as "SOLO") was started in 1970 by Thomas Dwyer. This was framed as an experimental program for "researching and testing the potential of computers for the range of subjects found in large urban school systems."
      </p>

      <p>
        This project, one of the many that aligned with educational computing, also provides an interesting start to a history that focuses on a path from mathematical games, to topographical navigation games, to adventure games.
      </p>

      <h2>Starting Project Solo</h2>

      <p>
        Project Solo was initially formed as part of the Special Interest Group on Computer Uses in Education (SIGCUE) within the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
      </p>

      <p>
        The inception document for the project was published in the society's newsletter <em>Interface</em> (Volume 4, Issue 1) in February 1970. You can see this full document as <a href="../assets/docs/project-solo/project-solo-inception.pdf" data-size="185 KB">"Project Solo: A Statement of Position Regarding CAI and Creativity"</a>, where "CAI" refers to "Computer-Assisted Instruction." A key part of the focus is stated right at the start of that document.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Primary emphasis is being placed on the importance of each student as a creative person who can learn to use the computer as an exploratory tool.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It was a bit later, specifically issue 23 of the project's newsletter, from November 1972, where the project was described again in a very succinct way:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Project Solo is an experimental program concerned with exploring the potential of computers in the hands of high school teachers and students. The project tested its ideas during 1970-72 in three large public schools in Pittsburgh where several hundred students learned to use computers in "solo" mode.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That last bit of wording is important. Dwyer characterized educational programming as having two modes: dual and solo. The "Project Solo" name was meant to reference the transition of a pilot learning to fly, going from "dual flying" with an instructor to "solo flying" alone. However, as the inception document states:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It is important to notice that SOLO implies more than "student alone." It means that the student must make his way on his own, but <ins>within</ins> a highly structured, well-prepared environment.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Essentially, in Dwyer's scheme, the computer would serve as the enabling "system" that allowed a "solo mode" to take place. Here the student would not be working with the guided attention of a teacher ("dual mode") but rather exploring on their own in the context of a constrained system.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        I highly recommend reading this short inception document because it makes you realize how far we've come <em>away</em> from what was being attempted here and how unfortunate that is.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of 1973, Project Solo became known as Solo Works (sometimes written as "Soloworks"). The official name of the new project was "A Computer-Based High School Mathematics Laboratory." In the aforementioned issue 23, the following is stated about the project:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Soloworks is officially a project to develop new approaches to high school mathematics education.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Also:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        'Soloworks' is also a statement of philosophy, affirming our belief that <ins>any</ins> student can be brought into the world of solo-mode learning by an intelligent use of technology.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The project focus ultimately saw a future where it would be possible to augment the world of computing by considering different interfaces.

      <p>
        One such idea, as shown in the above visual, was that of a lunar lander that might present an actual visual user interface but, behind the scenes, is driven by a series of mathematical calculations. The mathematical underpinning of this was still quite crucial. The project as a whole was now focusing on the "critical transitional period in math education."
