      <h1>The Huntington Project</h1>

      <p>
        This article follows on from the People's Computer Center concept as a slight path that shows us another aspect of project that was going on at the same time.

      <h2>PCC in the Wider Context</h2>

      <p>
        Bob Albrecht did his best to keep abreast of all the computer education projects across the United States and reported on them whenever he could. A great case in point is in the very first PCC newsletter issue which mentions the Huntington Project.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Huntington Project has developed and distributed the most comprehensive set of computer simulation programs written in BASIC that we have seen. NSF (National Science Foundation) funded this project from 1968 to 1970 at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. ... [These programs] are so good that DEC and HP have reprinted the programs and make them available to their school users.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Huntington Computer Project spanned eight years, two universities, hundreds of schools, and thousands of students. A good resource for understanding the project is <a href="../assets/docs/pcc/ERIC-ED089740.pdf" data-size="952 KB">"The Use of Computer Simulations in High School Curricula"</a> by Marian Visich Jr. and Ludwig Braun from January 1974 (<a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED089740">ERIC Source</a>).
