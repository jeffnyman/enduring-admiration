      <h1>The Huntington Project</h1>

      <p>
        This article follows on from the People's Computer Center concept as a slight path that shows us another aspect of project that was going on at the same time.

      <h2>PCC in the Wider Context</h2>

      <p>
        Bob Albrecht did his best to keep abreast of all the computer education projects across the United States and reported on them whenever he could. A great case in point is in the very first PCC newsletter issue which mentions the Huntington Project.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Huntington Project has developed and distributed the most comprehensive set of computer simulation programs written in BASIC that we have seen. NSF (National Science Foundation) funded this project from 1968 to 1970 at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. ... [These programs] are so good that DEC and HP have reprinted the programs and make them available to their school users.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Huntington Computer Project spanned eight years, two universities, hundreds of schools, and thousands of students. A good resource for understanding the project is <a href="../assets/docs/pcc/ERIC-ED089740.pdf" data-size="952 KB">"The Use of Computer Simulations in High School Curricula"</a> by Marian Visich Jr. and Ludwig Braun from January 1974 (<a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED089740">ERIC Source</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's consider the Huntington Project in a bit of detail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ludwig Braun, a professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (New York), received a grant from the NSF in 1967 to explore the use of computers in the high school curriculum. Braun, like Albrecht, caught the computing bug during the 1960s. He visited John Kemeny and Tom Kurtz in Hanover to learn about time-sharing, BASIC, and students teaching the computer, and he, too, became hooked on BASIC as the people's computing language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the course of that first three-year project, Braun demonstrated compelling educational value in computing simulations, and the NSF awarded him another two-year grant to develop those simulations.
      </p>

      <p>
        By January 1974, the Huntington Project had produced seventeen simulations and support materials for use in primary and secondary school classrooms. The programs for the simulations &mdash; written in BASIC &mdash; were transmitted via paper tape (read by a teletypewriter), and they were accompanied by a teacher's manual, a student's manual, and a resource manual.
      </p>

      <p>
        The simulations reflected the concerns and issues of the day: water pollution, population growth, and domestic policy, for example. After testing and tweaking the simulations during 1970 to 1972, Braun and assistant director Marian Visich (writer of the previously mentioned paper) arranged for DEC to publish and distribute the Huntington Project materials in the spring of 1972.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's consider that paper. The paper "The Use of Computer Simulations in High School Curricula" from 1974 talks about the "Huntington Computer Project simulation programs."
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        During the period 1967-70, the National Science Foundation supported the exploration, by the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, of the uses of digital computers in high school curricula. More than 80 high school teachers and more than 3,000 students in 30 school districts participated in this effort.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This was the initial Huntington Computer Project. This was then followed up with “a two-year project for the period 1970-72 whose purpose was to develop simulation materials to support high school curricula in biology, physics,and social studies.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the second Huntington Computer Project, called “Huntington Two.” In this phase of the project, material was “distributed to some 175 teachers in 80 high schools around the United States.” The second project was extended to 1974.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially it's said that “the Huntington Two staff sought a publisher for its material” and this was done to provide a wider distribution of the simulation packages created for the project. DEC was chosen as the publisher. Regarding the impact of this, it's said that “DEC sold 25,000 manuals associated with nine simulations in biology, physics, and social studies.It is estimated that these units were utilized in 400 schools, by 600 teachers working with over 25,000 students.” This was crucial and the paper indicates the context as to why.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        A major inhibition to the use of computers in instruction at the high school level is the lack of adequate amounts of high quality computer-related materials. Frequently, even after a school system acquires a computer (or terminals into a computer),the teachers and administrators don't know what to do with it.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Expanding on that:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The student usually has a background which is not adequate for the development of suitable material; while the high school teacher, even when highly motivated and sufficiently talented and knowledgeable, is so heavily loaded with teaching and other responsibilities, that he has little time or energy for development of computer programs.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The result was predictable.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The result of this is that many of the schools which have computers make very ineffective use of their computer time.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The concern was evident:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        There is such a serious shortage of adequate amounts of reasonably good computer material that it already has dampened the enthusiasm of many educators, and is likely to continue impeding substantially the development of this important educational tool, even when the cost of the computer time is within easy reach of every school.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Thus was a Catch-22 occurring:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Normally, such a need may be expected to attract commercial publishers; however, the combination of the large investment required, and the presently limited market, has resulted in a uniform lack of interest among publishers.Until there is an adequate market, publishers will not support or encourage the development of computer material; and until there is an adequate body of computer material, few schools other than the innovative ones, will be willing to invest money in computers.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        A particular note was made clear.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It should be emphasized that it is not proposed here that simulations be used to replace good laboratory experience. Rather,it is proposed that simulations be used where such experiences are unavailable.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        “In the 1969-70 school year, 2,900 (or 13%) of 22,000 high schools interrogated were using computers in instruction.” This was from the Survey of Computing Activities in Secondary Schools, done by the American Institute for Research in October 1970.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a Teacher's Manual. This is what it sounds like: a guide for teachers on how to implement the program. Crucially a sample run of a given simulation was provided.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a Resource Manual. This was to best explain the model that the simulation was based on. This is where the subject matter of the simulation was covered. Crucially these provided ideas for changing parameter values.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a Student Manual. These were instructions for the student.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two examples will serve. POLUT. This dealt with the effects of pollutants on different bodies of water and the effectiveness of certain anti-pollution measures. SLITS. This dealt with Young's double slit experiment, focusing on the interference of light waves.

        We can also consider <a href="../assets/docs/pcc/braun-1972-digital-simulation-in-education.pdf" data-size="637 KB">"Digital Simulation in Education"</a> by Ludwig Braun. This was part of Journal of Educational Technology Systems Volume 1, Issue 1 from September 1972.
      </p>

      <p>
        This paper talks about simulation as a "mode of computation." A simulation is defined as a "simplified representation of a real-world system." These are models and they can be specialized to greater and lesser degrees. For example, there are mathematical models. These are models which represent a physical system by a set of mathematical equations. These models can be implemented on a digital computer.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It should be emphasized that simulation is proposed as a complement to existing educational techniques, rather than as a substitute for any of them.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Albrecht's People's Computer Company vigorously endorsed the Huntington Project, whose materials had also been distributed by DEC in its efforts to sell to educational users, and through which thousands of students and amateur computing enthusiasts entered the novel world of computing simulations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Huntington Computer Project &mdash; with programs for students and educators written in BASIC and distributed by DEC &mdash; developed simulations about pollution and population modeling. Albrecht used those Huntington Project simulations in his computing roadshow, demonstrating them on a DEC minicomputer.
