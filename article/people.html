      <h1>Keeping People in Computing</h1>

      <p>
        The idea of people being front-and-center of computation, and thus technology, once held sway but has often been in danger from a wider technocracy. Here I want to focus on what "people's computing" in the broad strokes was.
      </p>

      <h2>An Implied Ontology</h2>

      <p>
        The concept of "people's computing" as an implied ontology, rather than a concrete historical era, introduces a specific perspective. Ontologically, it suggests that categorizing a particular period as "people's computing" is a construct we apply retrospectively to encapsulate shared values, practices, and attitudes.
      </p>

      <p>
        By acknowledging the constructed nature of this era, I mean to highlight the interpretive aspect of historical demarcation explicitly. It's not a predefined, objectively existing period but a lens through which we view and define a particular time slice. This approach aligns with the understanding that historical narratives are shaped by historians acting, in part, as storytellers, and the identification of distinct eras involves a certain level of subjectivity and interpretation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My emphasis on the implied ontology is hopefully prompting my readers to consider the fluidity of historical categorizations and the importance of recognizing our role in shaping the narrative. I hope this provides a nuanced perspective that encourages a critical reflection on how we conceptualize and frame historical periods, particularly in the realm of technology and computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope my focus on "people's computing" and the shift from a time when individuals were at the forefront of computation to the potential overshadowing by a broader technocracy is a compelling and relevant narrative thread. It speaks to the changing dynamics between people and technology over time.

        The notion of "people's computing" &mdash; during the 1965 to 1975 period &mdash; championed by groups like the People's Computer Center and figures like Bob Albrecht, serves as a poignant reminder of a time when the democratization of not just technology but computing was a driving force. It reflects a period when individuals, particularly students, were actively engaged in computing, using tools like BASIC to demystify and make technology accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I intend to delve into what "people's computing" was in broad strokes to explore the ethos and principles that characterized this era. This approach captures a historical moment and sets the stage for reflecting on the implications of a potential shift towards a more technocratic perspective.

      <h2>The Crucial Intersection</h2>

      <p>
        The basis for much of my Ludic Historian content is that I've extensively researched gaming history, particularly the distinctions between ludology and narratology. As I embarked on much of that research, I found an exciting starting point around where computing and education intersected. Here we see a young High School student in 1962:

      <p>
        Here we have a group of younger children in 1967:

      <p>
        In the April-June 2014 issue of <em>IEEE Annals of the History of Computing</em>, Joy Rankin wrote an article called <a href="../assets/docs/people/Toward-a-History-of-Social-Computing.pdf">"Toward a History of Social Computing: Children, Classrooms, Campuses, and Communities,"</a> and she says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I must underscore the methodological value of studying systems that originated in an educational context. Because many of the project publications were oriented toward readers in education, they often included meticulous details of users' encounters with the terminal, the language, the lessons, the appropriate syntax, and similar issues. These reports documented knowledge and practices that otherwise would have been tacit and unnoticed. Such descriptions are immensely helpful for historians seeking to understand and describe novel computing experiences.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I entirely agree! This intersection provided a fertile ground for the development of computer games and artificial intelligence, the latter of which was often used with and against the former to determine its viability and actuality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, by way of example, we have Arthur Samuel, in 1959, who published an algorithm for a checkers program using artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I think is very interesting is that while gaming saw a great deal of experimentation because it became democratized &mdash; due to the democratization of computing &mdash; there was less of this with artificial intelligence. The latter was not as democratized, and limited democratization meant that experimentation primarily occurred within the realms of researchers or academics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, people, in the broad sense, were front-and-center with gaming-as-computation and very much in the background with AI-as-computation. How ludology and narratology influenced that, even though the terms were not yet in use, is something best covered by example. I will show some of those examples in various other articles. For now, I want to dig into history and look at how humans and technology intersected at pivotal moments.
