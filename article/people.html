      <h1>Keeping People in Computing</h1>

      <p>
        The idea of people being front-and-center of computation, and thus technology, once held sway but has often been in danger from a wider technocracy. Here I want to focus on what "people's computing" in the broad strokes was.
      </p>

      <h2>An Implied Ontology</h2>

      <p>
        The concept of "people's computing" as an implied ontology, rather than a concrete historical era, introduces a specific perspective. Ontologically, it suggests that categorizing a particular period as "people's computing" is a construct we apply retrospectively to encapsulate shared values, practices, and attitudes.
      </p>

      <p>
        By acknowledging the constructed nature of this era, I mean to highlight the interpretive aspect of historical demarcation explicitly. It's not a predefined, objectively existing period but a lens through which we view and define a particular time slice. This approach aligns with the understanding that historical narratives are shaped by historians acting, in part, as storytellers, and the identification of distinct eras involves a certain level of subjectivity and interpretation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My emphasis on the implied ontology is hopefully prompting my readers to consider the fluidity of historical categorizations and the importance of recognizing our role in shaping the narrative. I hope this provides a nuanced perspective that encourages a critical reflection on how we conceptualize and frame historical periods, particularly in the realm of technology and computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope my focus on "people's computing" and the shift from a time when individuals were at the forefront of computation to the potential overshadowing by a broader technocracy is a compelling and relevant narrative thread. It speaks to the changing dynamics between people and technology over time.

      <p>
        The notion of "people's computing" &mdash; during the 1965 to 1975 period &mdash; championed by groups like the People's Computer Center and figures like Bob Albrecht, serves as a poignant reminder of a time when the democratization of not just technology but computing was a driving force. It reflects a period when individuals, particularly students, were actively engaged in computing, using tools like BASIC to demystify and make technology accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I intend to delve into what "people's computing" was in broad strokes to explore the ethos and principles that characterized this era. This approach captures a historical moment and sets the stage for reflecting on the implications of a potential shift towards a more technocratic perspective.

      <h2>The Crucial Intersection</h2>

      <p>
        The basis for much of my Ludic Historian content is that I've extensively researched gaming history, particularly the distinctions between ludology and narratology. As I embarked on much of that research, I found an exciting starting point around where computing and education intersected. Here we see a young High School student in 1962:

      <p>
        Here we have a group of younger children in 1967:
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/people/edu-computing-kids-in-1967.jpg" width="756" height="580" alt="Photograph of young children in a classroom in 1967 using computing technology.">

      <p>
        In the April-June 2014 issue of <em>IEEE Annals of the History of Computing</em>, Joy Rankin wrote an article called <a href="../assets/docs/people/Toward-a-History-of-Social-Computing.pdf">"Toward a History of Social Computing: Children, Classrooms, Campuses, and Communities,"</a> and she says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I must underscore the methodological value of studying systems that originated in an educational context. Because many of the project publications were oriented toward readers in education, they often included meticulous details of users' encounters with the terminal, the language, the lessons, the appropriate syntax, and similar issues. These reports documented knowledge and practices that otherwise would have been tacit and unnoticed. Such descriptions are immensely helpful for historians seeking to understand and describe novel computing experiences.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I entirely agree! This intersection provided a fertile ground for the development of computer games and artificial intelligence, the latter of which was often used with and against the former to determine its viability and actuality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, by way of example, we have Arthur Samuel, in 1959, who published an algorithm for a checkers program using artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/people/arthur-samuel-1959-checkers.jpg" width="500" height="364" alt="Photograph of Arthur Samuel in 1959 with a checkers playing algorithm.">

      <p>
        What I think is very interesting is that while gaming saw a great deal of experimentation because it became democratized &mdash; due to the democratization of computing &mdash; there was less of this with artificial intelligence. The latter was not as democratized, and limited democratization meant that experimentation primarily occurred within the realms of researchers or academics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, people, in the broad sense, were front-and-center with gaming-as-computation and very much in the background with AI-as-computation. How ludology and narratology influenced that, even though the terms were not yet in use, is something best covered by example. I will show some of those examples in various other articles. For now, I want to dig into history and look at how humans and technology intersected at pivotal moments.
      </p>

      <h2>A Historical Pivot Point</h2>

      <p>
        A very crucial moment in the microelectronic revolution, which eventually led to computing becoming accessible to many people, was the launch of the Sputnik satellite on 4 October 1957 by the Soviet Union.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/people/sputnik-report.jpg" width="894" height="708" alt="New York Times front page headline on 5 October 1957 announcing the launch of Sputnik I.">

      <p>
        In the United States, the launch of Sputnik provided the impetus for administrators and educators to reconsider American education.
      </p>

      <p>
        The government and the broader research and educational establishment felt a "space race" was coming &mdash; or, more broadly, a technology race &mdash; and thus, American education had to prepare its youth for that. Better schooling was required, particularly around math and science.
      </p>

      <h2>Computing in Education</h2>

      <p>
        In September 1958, the United States Congress passed the National Defense Education Act.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/people/defense-education-act.jpg" width="466" height="700" alt="National defense education act: Report to accompany H.R. 13247 published 1 January 1958.">

      <p>
        It was not exactly riveting reading, but it provided funds to improve teaching, with an emphasis on teaching science and mathematics. The federal government thus made money available for "innovative approaches" to education. A primary focus of innovation in this context was using technology in the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Money supplied by the government and private institutions like the Carnegie and Ford Foundations made it possible during the early 1960s for schools to experiment with new and innovative educational methods around technology. Not surprisingly, this impetus for adding technology into schools had a direct impact on the history of computing.
      </p>

      <h2>A Mythology Formed</h2>

      <p>
        If you investigate this history, you will generally encounter persistent mythology in computing. That mythology is that computing went directly from a type of priesthood or elite mainframe computing model to the liberation from this by the so-called "homebrew hobbyists."
      </p>

      <p>
        These hobbyists were non-professionals who "worked out of their garage" &mdash; hence the "homebrew" &mdash; and ultimately gave us personal computers, one entry point being the kit-based Altair in 1975 to the 1977 "trinity" of the Commodore PET, Apple II, and TRS-80.
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/images/people/trinity-1977.jpg" width="1280" height="597" alt="Picture of three machines that formed the 1977 Trinity of personal computers.">

      <p>
        Usually, the Commodore and TRS-80 are left out of the mythology by chroniclers, and they seemingly assume that Apple was solely responsible for carrying the world into a new golden age, which is the view they consciously or unconsciously promote.
      </p>

      <p>
        This evolution, promoted by the mythology, eventually led into the early 1980s with the IBM PC and its various clones. Those developments ultimately led to diversification in the 1990s as the "World Wide Web" became the face of the existing Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, the general form of the mythology is that we had corporate/institutional computing, and then we had personal computing. And the shift between those computing modes was dramatic and instituted by relatively few people. And these were "special" people who became "big names," such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet, in between those institutional and personal computing contexts, we had what we might want to call "people's computing." This computing mode is a part of the history &mdash; and a considerable part &mdash; that often gets entirely dismissed, assuming it's even known about at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        This people's computing era is the crucible era that I referred to in my <a href="./crucible.html">Computing and Crucible Eras</a> article. There was a decade, from 1965 to 1975, where students, educators, and enthusiasts &mdash; ordinary people and not "big names" &mdash; created personal and social computing before personal computers or the broadly public and accessible Internet became available. At that time, the newly emerging people-focused computing access moved in lockstep with network access via time-shared systems.
