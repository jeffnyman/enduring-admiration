      <h1>Keeping People in Computing</h1>

      <p>
        The idea of people being front-and-center of computation, and thus technology, once held sway but has often been in danger from a wider technocracy. Here I want to focus on what "people's computing" in the broad strokes was.
      </p>

      <h2>An Implied Ontology</h2>

      <p>
        The concept of "people's computing" as an implied ontology, rather than a concrete historical era, introduces a specific perspective. Ontologically, it suggests that categorizing a particular period as "people's computing" is a construct we apply retrospectively to encapsulate shared values, practices, and attitudes.
      </p>

      <p>
        By acknowledging the constructed nature of this era, I mean to highlight the interpretive aspect of historical demarcation explicitly. It's not a predefined, objectively existing period but a lens through which we view and define a particular time slice. This approach aligns with the understanding that historical narratives are shaped by historians acting, in part, as storytellers, and the identification of distinct eras involves a certain level of subjectivity and interpretation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My emphasis on the implied ontology is hopefully prompting my readers to consider the fluidity of historical categorizations and the importance of recognizing our role in shaping the narrative. I hope this provides a nuanced perspective that encourages a critical reflection on how we conceptualize and frame historical periods, particularly in the realm of technology and computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope my focus on "people's computing" and the shift from a time when individuals were at the forefront of computation to the potential overshadowing by a broader technocracy is a compelling and relevant narrative thread. It speaks to the changing dynamics between people and technology over time.
