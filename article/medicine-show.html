      <h1>Bob Albrecht and Medicine Shows</h1>

      <p>
        Let's start with a guy named Bob Albrecht. A useful reference is an <a href="https://hclemuseum.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/interview-with-bob-albrecht-by-jon-cappetta-2/">interview with Bob Albrecht in 2015</a> (<a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/bob-albrecht-interview-by-jon-cappetta.pdf" data-sizes="582 KB">PDF version</a>). There's a lot of detail in the interview, but the central relevant part is this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I wrote about these kids in Datamation magazine in about 1964 and the article I wrote was called a Modern Day Medicine Show.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Who are "these kids," and what was this article? The reference here is to <em>Datamation</em> magazine in July of 1963, and the article Albrecht wrote was indeed called <a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/modern-day-medicine-show-1963.pdf" data-size="1 MB">"A modern-day medicine show"</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The context of <em>Datamation</em> is quite interesting. This computer magazine was published in print in the United States between 1957 and 1998. You can see a <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/magazines/Datamation/">series of back issues of <em>Datamation</em></a>. In the late 1950s, the United States government was concerned about its technological prowess worldwide. In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, clearly pulling them ahead in the space race. That same month, Donald Prell launched <em>Datamation</em> magazine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prell was a computer hardware salesman who had looked around for someplace to advertise what he was selling but needed more suitable print outlets. So, he revived a failing engineering magazine that had started in 1955 called <em>Research & Engineering</em>. Prell called his new magazine <em>Datamation</em>, a name created by combining the words "data" and "automation." This magazine was America's first computer magazine, reporting on the country's nascent technology industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this article, we learn that in the spring of 1962, Albrecht spoke to students at George Washington High School, specifically about using computers to solve math problems. Then, in the summer of 1962, Albrecht held a course at the Control Data Corporation Denver office, where he worked. During this course, students used computers to solve math problems. This course continued through 1962 into 1963.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Control Data Corporation (CDC) was a mainframe and supercomputer company that in the 1960s was one of the nine major United States computer companies, a group which included IBM, the Burroughs Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the NCR Corporation (NCR), General Electric, and Honeywell, RCA, and UNIVAC. The Control Data Corporation was founded in Minneapolis in 1957.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the article, we also learn that on 24 March 1963, Control Data gave a 160A and a Flexowriter to the George Washington High School. The 160A refers to a machine in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_160_series">CDC 160 series of minicomputers</a> built by Control Data Corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a historical context, the CDC 160 computer, introduced in 1960, was the first tiny computer to hit the market. This machine and the DEC PDP-1 may both fairly claim to be the first transistorized computers to come to market, but the DEC machine was hardly small; a PDP-1 filled approximately three standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack">nineteen-inch relay racks</a>, while the CDC-160 was packaged to look like a traditional double-pedestal office desk. At that time, the base configuration for a CDC 160A cost $110,000. For that, you bought yourself the CPU, minimal memory, a high-speed paper tape reader, a medium-speed punch, and a flexowriter. An assembler and a four-kilobyte FORTRAN compiler were available, but not much else.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        While computer historians don't talk about the CDC-160 computer as all that important in early computing, it was one of the most significant predecessors of the DEC PDP-8 computer, and computer historians <em>do</em> generally recognize the latter as the most important small computer of the 1960s. You can see some <a href="https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~dwjones/cdc160/photo/">CDC 160 photos</a> for context.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the <em>Datamation</em> article, the course was extended by the organizers to "eight other schools in Denver and Jefferson counties." You can see some of the <a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/medicine-show-media-coverage-1963.pdf" data-size="315 KB">media coverage of the "medicine show"</a> at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few things stand out in those clippings of the coverage. The article from <em>The Denver Post</em> on 3 April 1963 has Albrecht, along with Irvin Hoffman, saying, "Problem-solving through the use of computers gives students a deeper insight into math and encourages them toward self-education in the subject." The clipping from <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> on 29 August 1963 has Albrecht and Hoffman confirming that the goal of the project was to "teach mathematics, not computers."
