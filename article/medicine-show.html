      <h1>Bob Albrecht and Medicine Shows</h1>

      <p>
        Let's start with a guy named Bob Albrecht. A useful reference is an <a href="https://hclemuseum.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/interview-with-bob-albrecht-by-jon-cappetta-2/">interview with Bob Albrecht in 2015</a> (<a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/bob-albrecht-interview-by-jon-cappetta.pdf" data-sizes="582 KB">PDF version</a>). There's a lot of detail in the interview, but the central relevant part is this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I wrote about these kids in Datamation magazine in about 1964 and the article I wrote was called a Modern Day Medicine Show.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Who are "these kids," and what was this article? The reference here is to <em>Datamation</em> magazine in July of 1963, and the article Albrecht wrote was indeed called <a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/modern-day-medicine-show-1963.pdf" data-size="1 MB">"A modern-day medicine show"</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The context of <em>Datamation</em> is quite interesting. This computer magazine was published in print in the United States between 1957 and 1998. You can see a <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/magazines/Datamation/">series of back issues of <em>Datamation</em></a>. In the late 1950s, the United States government was concerned about its technological prowess worldwide. In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, clearly pulling them ahead in the space race. That same month, Donald Prell launched <em>Datamation</em> magazine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prell was a computer hardware salesman who had looked around for someplace to advertise what he was selling but needed more suitable print outlets. So, he revived a failing engineering magazine that had started in 1955 called <em>Research & Engineering</em>. Prell called his new magazine <em>Datamation</em>, a name created by combining the words "data" and "automation." This magazine was America's first computer magazine, reporting on the country's nascent technology industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this article, we learn that in the spring of 1962, Albrecht spoke to students at George Washington High School, specifically about using computers to solve math problems. Then, in the summer of 1962, Albrecht held a course at the Control Data Corporation Denver office, where he worked. During this course, students used computers to solve math problems. This course continued through 1962 into 1963.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Control Data Corporation (CDC) was a mainframe and supercomputer company that in the 1960s was one of the nine major United States computer companies, a group which included IBM, the Burroughs Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the NCR Corporation (NCR), General Electric, and Honeywell, RCA, and UNIVAC. The Control Data Corporation was founded in Minneapolis in 1957.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the article, we also learn that on 24 March 1963, Control Data gave a 160A and a Flexowriter to the George Washington High School. The 160A refers to a machine in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_160_series">CDC 160 series of minicomputers</a> built by Control Data Corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a historical context, the CDC 160 computer, introduced in 1960, was the first tiny computer to hit the market. This machine and the DEC PDP-1 may both fairly claim to be the first transistorized computers to come to market, but the DEC machine was hardly small; a PDP-1 filled approximately three standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack">nineteen-inch relay racks</a>, while the CDC-160 was packaged to look like a traditional double-pedestal office desk. At that time, the base configuration for a CDC 160A cost $110,000. For that, you bought yourself the CPU, minimal memory, a high-speed paper tape reader, a medium-speed punch, and a flexowriter. An assembler and a four-kilobyte FORTRAN compiler were available, but not much else.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        While computer historians don't talk about the CDC-160 computer as all that important in early computing, it was one of the most significant predecessors of the DEC PDP-8 computer, and computer historians <em>do</em> generally recognize the latter as the most important small computer of the 1960s. You can see some <a href="https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~dwjones/cdc160/photo/">CDC 160 photos</a> for context.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the <em>Datamation</em> article, the course was extended by the organizers to "eight other schools in Denver and Jefferson counties." You can see some of the <a href="../assets/docs/medicine-show/medicine-show-media-coverage-1963.pdf" data-size="315 KB">media coverage of the "medicine show"</a> at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few things stand out in those clippings of the coverage. The article from <em>The Denver Post</em> on 3 April 1963 has Albrecht, along with Irvin Hoffman, saying, "Problem-solving through the use of computers gives students a deeper insight into math and encourages them toward self-education in the subject." The clipping from <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> on 29 August 1963 has Albrecht and Hoffman confirming that the goal of the project was to "teach mathematics, not computers."
      </p>

      <p>
        The "Medicine Show" article provides a FORTRAN listing that students were working on, and I think it's worth considering that to an extent. Consider the following:
      </p>

      <p>
         Consider these statements:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        10    FORMAT (I5, 4E16.8)
        11    FORMAT (4E16.8)

        500   READ 10, JWHICH, A, B, C
              GO TO (15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105), JWHICH
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Lines 10 and 11 define input/output formats. Lines 500 and 501 read input values (JWHICH, A, B, C) using the <code>READ</code> statement with format 10 and then branch to a specific label based on the value of JWHICH.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Line numbers were typically used as labels for statements rather than being strictly sequential. The numbers were used to identify the sequence of execution and control flow rather than necessarily indicating their order in the program.
      </p>

      <p>
        When taken as a whole, this program calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots. Based on the discriminant, if the discriminant is non-zero, the program calculates two distinct real roots. If the discriminant is zero, the program calculates the repeated real root (with real and imaginary parts). The program then prints the coefficients and the roots of the equation. Just for context, in case math isn't your thing, the discriminant acts like a tool for the program to understand how many and what kind of solutions the quadratic equation has based on whether it "touches" an imaginary number line in one, two, or zero places.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on his success, as indicated by the media coverage, Albrecht convinced Control Data to allow him to take the medicine show across the country. Albrecht eventually moved to Minnesota, where Control Data had its headquarters. It was there that someone showed Albrecht BASIC. The context for this is that Albrecht taught programming at the University of Minnesota Laboratory High School, which, by 1965, featured a computing connection to the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS), where the young mathematics teachers praised BASIC. Albrecht became a convert. In his words from the interview:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I said that's it! No more Fortran, so I started traveling all over the country crusading for BASIC. ... I lobbied, ranted, and raved for BASIC.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Steven Levy, in his book <em>Hackers</em>, provides some more context around Albrecht's conversion.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Albrecht immediately decided that BASIC was <em>it</em>, and FORTRAN was dead. BASIC was interactive, so that people hungry for computer use would get instant response from the machine (FORTRAN was geared for batch processing). It used English-like words like INPUT, and THEN, and GOTO, so it was easier to learn. And it had a built-in random number generator, so kids could use it to write games quickly. Albrecht knew even then that games would provide the seductive scent that would lure kids to programming - and hackerism.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This focus seems to be that BASIC was better suited to the kind of work that Albrecht was doing with students in that it was more accessible to them than FORTRAN. Levy's statement that Albrecht had at least some focus on games is interesting as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Albrecht gives a few references in the interview that allow us some insight into the historical context. Albrecht became involved with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). When the NCTM appointed a Computer-Oriented Mathematics Committee, Albrecht was on it. The committee published the book <em>Computer Facilities for Mathematics Instruction</em> in 1967, an introduction to computing, and a book on BASIC. Apparently, as part of this, or at least in the context of it, Albrecht established the Society to Help Abolish FORTRAN Teaching (SHAFT).
      </p>

      <p>
        Another reference refers to a booklet called <em>Introduction to an Algorithmic Language (BASIC)</em>, which Albrecht had a hand in. This booklet was published in 1968 by the NCTM. Yet another reference is the book <em>Computer Methods in Mathematics</em>, published in 1969. Further situating the history, Albrecht, in the interview, refers to the "Midpeninsula Free University." This group ran from 1966 to 1971 but had its most active years in 1968 and 1969. (I have no idea what the "2848" referred to in the interview means in this context.)
      </p>

      <p>
        This history is also situated when Albrecht mentions Hewlett Packard's first programmable calculator, which he mistakenly remembers as the 9600. HP's first calculator was the 9100A, which came out in March of 1968, followed by the 9100B in the fall of 1969. The Wang calculator also being mentioned would have been the 7800 series which came out in mid-1969.
      </p>

      <h2>The Portola Institute</h2>

      <p>
        All of this history starts to take us into something called the Portola Institute. Albrecht lays the scene for us in the interview.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Every Thursday evening I would run computer programming, wine tasting, and Greek dancing parties. A guy named Dick Raymond came to one of these. Dick told us how he had an idle, non-profit corporation that isn't doing anything right now, and this looks like something that might be fun to do.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The nonprofit mentioned here was Portola. The creators of the company billed it as a "nonprofit educational foundation" that Dick Raymond had started up in Menlo Park, California in 1966.
      </p>

      <p>
        A guy named Stewart Brand came to Portola and set up his group, which eventually, via Portola's resources, produced and published the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/1stWEC-complete/mode/2up">first issue</a> of which came out in the fall of 1968. That first issue notes that the catalog is one division of "The Portola Institute" and that other activities of the Institute include "computer education for all grade levels" and "simulation games for classroom use." Those points are relevant to the idea of people's computing that I'm building toward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working with LeRoy Finkel, Albrecht formed a group within Portola called DYMAX, the name of which came from, according to Albrecht, the "dymaxian world of Buckminster Fuller." This naming was in honor of Buckminster Fuller's trademarked word "dymaxion," combining the words "dynamism" and "maximum." Albrecht describes this in the interview.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        My little group eventually split off. We went and found a cheap warehouse in Redwood City and set up there. We had a couple of PDP-8 computers on loan. The PDP-8 ran four terminals with BASIC using high-speed paper tape input, 10 characters a second and high-speed printer output — Teletype model 33. So various people came drifting in to use this equipment.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        As a bit of context, the DEC PDP-8 computer, introduced on 22 March 1965, is generally recognized as the most important small computer of the 1960s. It was the least expensive parallel general-purpose computer on the market, the first computer sold on a retail basis, and the first such digital computer sold in a table-top configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The context here suggests that Albrecht and his group found a mutually beneficial partnership with DEC. DEC salespeople traveled with the PDPs in their trunks for demonstrations, and Albrecht put his in the back of his Volkswagen. Albrecht used the minicomputer to bring his traveling computing and BASIC show to students and educators around California.
