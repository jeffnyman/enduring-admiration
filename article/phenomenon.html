      <h1>The Phenomenon of the New Testament</h1>

      <p>
        This book is subtitled <em>An Inquiry into the Implications of Certain Features of the New Testament</em>, written by Charles Francis Digby "Charlie" Moule (known professionally as C.F.D. Moule), and published in 1967. The book is part of the <em>Studies in Biblical Theology</em> (Second Series 1), which is a series of monographs designed to provide clergy and laymen with the best work in biblical scholarship.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contents of the book are part of The David S. Schaff Lectures, specifically from a series of five lectures presented on 18-22 April 1966 at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. These lectures were in turn based on previous lectures from 1962 in the Queen's University of Belfast. The contents of Appendix 1 were originally published in 1952 and the contents of Appendix 2 were originally published in 1959.

        A key question being asked is the following: Is Christianity based on insufficient evidence?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        What does apologetic imply about the nature of history in relation to Christian faith? Is not Christian faith something that not only does not need to defend itself, but by definition cannot begin to produce evidence without ceasing to be faith?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This gets into the idea of trying to "prove Christianity," in the broad sense, one method of which has been the "Life of Jesus" research of the so-called "questors" for the "Historical Jesus."
      </p>

        <em>Von Reimarus zu Wrede</em> is a book written by Albert Schweitzer, published in 1906. The English translation of the title is "From Reimarus to Wrede." In this work, Schweitzer examines the historical quest for the historical Jesus and critiques various scholars' approaches and interpretations during the 18th and 19th centuries. Schweitzer's book is particularly known for its significant impact on the study of the historical Jesus. He argued that many scholars of his time had projected their own views onto Jesus, creating a "Jesus in their own image." Schweitzer's own view was that Jesus was an eschatological figure who expected the imminent end of the world, and he emphasized the need for a historical understanding that considered the context of Jesus' time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before even that, Martin Kähler's work, <em>Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus</em> (translated as "The So-Called Historical Jesus and the Historical, Biblical Christ" in 1964 by C.E. Braaten), was published in 1892. In this book, Kähler also contributed to the discussions about the quest for the historical Jesus. Kähler's central argument was that the New Testament presented not just a historical Jesus but a Christ of faith, emphasizing the importance of the theological understanding of Christ as portrayed in the biblical narrative. He cautioned against trying to separate the historical Jesus from the Christ of faith, arguing that the significance of Jesus should be understood within the context of Christian belief.

      <p>
        Consider that Karl Barth, a prominent Swiss Reformed theologian, made the statement that "apologetics is the death of theology." Barth was critical of traditional apologetics, which aims to defend and justify religious beliefs through rational arguments. He believed that relying too much on human reason in defending faith could undermine the essence of theology, which, for him, should be centered on the revelation of God rather than human attempts to prove or justify it. Barth's perspective reflects his emphasis on the primacy of divine revelation and the limitations of human understanding in grasping the mysteries of faith.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I therefore unashamedly address myself to those who are prepared to allow to historical evidence a place in the considerations leading up to faith.
      </blockquote>

        Can we find phenomena undeniably attested by the New Testament? If so, we can then ask how we propose to account for those phenomena. What account can we provide to give of the processes leading to the phenomena? Essentially we're asking for the interpretation of facts and, even more specifically, what is the most plausible interpretation? On that point, D.E. Jenkins, in the 1965 <em>Jesus and God</em> says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christianity is based on indisputable facts .... I do not say that Christianity is the indisputable interpretation of these facts.
