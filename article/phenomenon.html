      <h1>The Phenomenon of the New Testament</h1>

      <p>
        This book is subtitled <em>An Inquiry into the Implications of Certain Features of the New Testament</em>, written by Charles Francis Digby "Charlie" Moule (known professionally as C.F.D. Moule), and published in 1967. The book is part of the <em>Studies in Biblical Theology</em> (Second Series 1), which is a series of monographs designed to provide clergy and laymen with the best work in biblical scholarship.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contents of the book are part of The David S. Schaff Lectures, specifically from a series of five lectures presented on 18-22 April 1966 at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. These lectures were in turn based on previous lectures from 1962 in the Queen's University of Belfast. The contents of Appendix 1 were originally published in 1952 and the contents of Appendix 2 were originally published in 1959.

        A key question being asked is the following: Is Christianity based on insufficient evidence?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        What does apologetic imply about the nature of history in relation to Christian faith? Is not Christian faith something that not only does not need to defend itself, but by definition cannot begin to produce evidence without ceasing to be faith?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This gets into the idea of trying to "prove Christianity," in the broad sense, one method of which has been the "Life of Jesus" research of the so-called "questors" for the "Historical Jesus."
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Von Reimarus zu Wrede</em> is a book written by Albert Schweitzer, published in 1906. The English translation of the title is "From Reimarus to Wrede." In this work, Schweitzer examines the historical quest for the historical Jesus and critiques various scholars' approaches and interpretations during the 18th and 19th centuries. Schweitzer's book is particularly known for its significant impact on the study of the historical Jesus. He argued that many scholars of his time had projected their own views onto Jesus, creating a "Jesus in their own image." Schweitzer's own view was that Jesus was an eschatological figure who expected the imminent end of the world, and he emphasized the need for a historical understanding that considered the context of Jesus' time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before even that, Martin Kähler's work, <em>Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus</em> (translated as "The So-Called Historical Jesus and the Historical, Biblical Christ" in 1964 by C.E. Braaten), was published in 1892. In this book, Kähler also contributed to the discussions about the quest for the historical Jesus. Kähler's central argument was that the New Testament presented not just a historical Jesus but a Christ of faith, emphasizing the importance of the theological understanding of Christ as portrayed in the biblical narrative. He cautioned against trying to separate the historical Jesus from the Christ of faith, arguing that the significance of Jesus should be understood within the context of Christian belief.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider that Karl Barth, a prominent Swiss Reformed theologian, made the statement that "apologetics is the death of theology." Barth was critical of traditional apologetics, which aims to defend and justify religious beliefs through rational arguments. He believed that relying too much on human reason in defending faith could undermine the essence of theology, which, for him, should be centered on the revelation of God rather than human attempts to prove or justify it. Barth's perspective reflects his emphasis on the primacy of divine revelation and the limitations of human understanding in grasping the mysteries of faith.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I therefore unashamedly address myself to those who are prepared to allow to historical evidence a place in the considerations leading up to faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Can we find phenomena undeniably attested by the New Testament? If so, we can then ask how we propose to account for those phenomena. What account can we provide to give of the processes leading to the phenomena? Essentially we're asking for the interpretation of facts and, even more specifically, what is the most plausible interpretation? On that point, D.E. Jenkins, in the 1965 <em>Jesus and God</em> says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christianity is based on indisputable facts .... I do not say that Christianity is the indisputable interpretation of these facts.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        There was an interesting review, in the London <em>Times</em> on 10 February 1966. This review was of C. S. Lewis' <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> (first published in 1942). The review says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        If Screwtape had read a later theology he would hardly have been afraid of humanity's <em>reasoning</em> itself into faith. An existentialist devil would have attacked not his victim's rationality, but his power of choice, his capacity for taking the leap. Or have persuaded his prey into a systematic, rational belief only to subvert it with the terrifying actuality of the absurd. But Screwtape seems to have been convinced by Chesterton — too easily it may seem to a later generation. . . . Screwtape, like so many apologists, is preaching only to the converted.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It's an interesting statement so let's pick it apart. The review suggests that Screwtape, the demonic protagonist, is overly concerned with humans reasoning themselves into faith. This, according to the reviewer, is a somewhat outdated perspective. The reviewer proposes an alternative strategy for a demon, drawing from the philosophy of existentialism. This approach would focus on attacking the human's freedom of choice and their ability to commit to faith (taking the leap). Another tactic suggested in the review involves encouraging the human to adopt a rational, systematic belief system only to undermine it later with the "terrifying actuality of the absurd." This implies exploiting the inherent contradictions and meaninglessness that the reviewer associates with existentialism.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reviewer suggests that Screwtape's arguments resemble those of Christian apologists, who are seen as primarily preaching to those already convinced. The implication is that Screwtape's tactics are ineffective for a modern audience, particularly those raised with a more nuanced understanding of faith and reason. The reviewer acknowledges that Screwtape's approach might seem "too easy" to a "later generation," implying a shift in how people approach faith and temptation in the years since the book's publication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of this review's idea, Moule says: "Rational conviction, even when it can be had, is very different from commitment." He quotes Walter Künneth from his book <em>The Theology of the Resurrection</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Christological question does not arise in the sphere of history pure and simple, but on its frontier, inasmuch as in the fact of Christ there emerges something absolutely unconditional, which is accessible only to faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Moule then asks us to compare that sentiment with one by Alan Richardson in his book <em>History Sacred and Profane</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christian theology has never suggested that the 'fact' of Christ's resurrection could be known apart from faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So what Moule is saying is that being committed to Christ is not purely an intellectual endeavor. While intellectual conviction may play some part, it most certainly is not the only part. Yet it is important. As Moule says, that committment "can never be achieved in defiance of the intellect."
      </p>

      <p>
        In looking at various reasons that some dismiss Christianity, usually based ultimately on psychological grounds, Moule says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christianity, on this showing, is to be explained by sincerely believed delusions, reinforced (we must add) by the comfort and security-value of so reassuring a faith. For good value, one can throw in the observation that it was coupled also with a great deal of moral goodness and warm fellowship which anyone might recognize as genuine, and which helped to lend momentum to the movement and make it attractive.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yet there is harm in this approach. Moule quotes Richard Niebuhr from his <em>Resurrection and Historical Reason</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Those who propound the psychological theories of the resurrection of Jesus usually fail to admit to the monstrous character of the interpretation of history which their theories have inevitably, if inadvertently, created.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yet Moule asks:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        May not Christianity be one more movement precipitated by a delusion but kept going by certain general, permanent truths and virtues?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Moule further says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        No Christian is going to deny that many an influential and vigorous movement has begun from a mistaken view of things and has survived and grown and prospered — provided always that the mistake contains enough of truth, or corresponds sufficiently to basic human needs or to the needs of the moment, ot has a leader forceful enough, for it to gain momentum.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Walter Künneth is quoted again:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The primitive Christian message ... did <em>not</em> make general statements about Jesus, but concentrated upon definite happenings, and brought out one singular event as the essential content of faith and as the ground of faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This singular event was the resurrection. So if this event was, in fact, a delusion or some type of fraud, Moule says this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        This alleged delusion has got to be strong enough (for they began with nothing else that was distinctive) to launch this 'sect', and tenacious enough to keep up their distinctiveness over against the pious Judaism to which they otherwise belonged.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So what Moule is concentrating on here, more narrowly, is the historian's question: What triggered off the Church in the first instance? As Moule says, this line of inquiry is "independent of, though complementary to, that which concentrates on original eye-witness to the risen Christ and the subsequent confirmation of the fact of the risen Christ throughout the Church's history."
      </p>

      <p>
        Quoting G.E. Ladd from <em>Jesus and the Kingdom</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The one thing which bound them together was their personal relationship to Jesus and his message about the Kingdom of God.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Moule argues that the relationship and the message have little to no meaning without the powerful event of the resurrection.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        At no point within the New Testament is there any evidence that the Christians stood for an original philosophy of life or an original ethic. Their sole function is to bear witness to what they claim as an event — the raising of Jesus from among the dead.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        the elements in the New Testament which a non-Christian would not share are precisely the ones which alone account for the Church's existence. They ate those which relate to and depend on the Christian estimate of Jesus as crucified and raised from among the dead, and of man's relationship to God through him.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        During the pre-exilic period, the prophets emphasized God's initiative and His Covenant with Israel, as well as humanity's complete reliance on God's unearned benevolence. This conviction and attitude permeated the subsequent religious literature of the Hebrews, encompassing certain passages found in the Dead Sea Scrolls of Qumran.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Book of Jeremiah, a renowned passage anticipated the eventual arrival of a new and superior Covenant (Jer. 31.31). However, the groundbreaking idea that God's graciousness and this New Covenant find their mediation and embodiment in Jesus of Nazareth was remarkably novel. Asserting that Jesus is the culmination of past ideals, thereby fulfilling them, is a truly astonishing conviction. The Old Testament Scriptures extensively discussed the realization of God's purposes through the leadership of chosen officials, be they kings or priests, or through the faithful obedience of a minority, even to the extent of enduring suffering and martyrdom. Yet, an entirely fresh perspective emerged, interpreting Scripture in a way that believed all these symbols and figures converged and merged into a singular figure of history. This figure belonged to recent history and, strikingly, was a condemned and disgraced criminal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept of the 'fulfillment' of the Scriptures in a solitary individual, asserted to be the cornerstone of the entire structure and the goal of God's overarching design, was groundbreaking. It was the Christian community that initially unified, around this singular focal point, the dispersed and largely disjointed images of Israel's aspirations. While perhaps a couple here and there had started to converge in earlier hopes, the entirely novel development was the gathering of all these images around a historical figure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Christians are well-acquainted with the notion that terms like 'Messiah,' 'Christ,' 'Son of God,' 'Son of Man,' 'Suffering Servant,' and 'Lord' are interchangeable, all referring to one central figure. However, there is no evidence indicating that this conflation of terms had occurred until the occurrence of the Christ event.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the terms "God's dedicated ones," (term indicating their belief that Jesus was the embodiment of pious Israelites' hopes), "those who are incorporated in Christ" (an indication of the new relationship mediated by Jesus), "believers" (an index of the essentially declaratory nature of the Christian <em>differentia</em>) and "the way" (the way of repentance, baptism, and faith &mdash; a religious way, not a new philosophy or ideology or ethic) can indeed be traced back to their original languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        God's dedicated ones in Greek: "Hagioi" (ἅγιοι), which translates to "saints" or "holy ones."
      </p>

      <p>
        Those who are incorporated in Christ In Greek: "En Christo" (ἐν Χριστῷ), emphasizing being in union with Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Believers in Greek: "Pistoi" (πιστοί), referring to those who have faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Way in Greek: "Hodos" (ὁδός), which can mean "way" or "path."
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Old Testament, the term equivalent to "God's dedicated ones" or "saints" is often associated with the Hebrew word "Qadosh" (קָדוֹשׁ). This term conveys the idea of being set apart, sacred, or holy. The plural form is "Qadoshim" (קָדוֹשִׁים), which can be translated as "holy ones" or "saints." As for "The Way," the concept of following a righteous path is present in the Hebrew Bible. The term "Derek" (דֶּרֶךְ) is frequently used, meaning "way" or "path." The idea of walking in the way of the Lord is a common theme in the Old Testament.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Hebrew or Aramaic equivalents are extremely rare in the Old Testament as a noun denoting human persons. See Deut. 33.3; Dan. 7.21 f., 8.24; Pss. 16.3, 34.9. Persons are frequently called 'holy' or told to become 'holy', but the use of the word as a noun ('holy one') is mostly confined, in its application, to angels. See Ps. 89.6, 8; Job 5.1, 15.5; Zech. 14.5; Dan. 4.10, 14, 20, 8.13. When, therefore, it is used in this nominal way of persons, it presumably reflects the consciousness of Israelite sectarianism. The Christians wanted to be 'true Israel.' It was their distinctive conviction about Jesus that made Israel thrust them out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Christians may have originally been known by themselves as "God's dedicated ones", which can be translated as "Οι αφιερωμένοι του Θεού" (pronounced: Oi afieromenoi tou Theou). The term "hagq°désim" in Hebrew, or "qadditin" in Aramaic, is more accurately translated as "the holy ones" or "the saints." It refers to individuals who are set apart or dedicated for a sacred or divine purpose. While it conveys a sense of dedication to God, the translation "God's dedicated ones" captures the essence of the term well. In the context of Deuteronomy 33:3, Daniel 7:21, Daniel 7:22, Daniel 8:24, Psalm 16:3, and Psalm 34:9, it often refers to those who are consecrated or set apart for a special relationship with God.
      </p>

      <p>
        The phrase "those who are incorporated in Christ" in Greek is "οἱ ἐν Χριστῷ" (pronounced: hoi en Christo). This expression signifies individuals who are united or joined with Christ, emphasizing a close association or incorporation into the body of believers. This is also how Christians self-identified. There is also the term "believers" in Greek is "πιστεύοντες" (pronounced: pisteuontes). There is also the term "the way" in Greek is "ἡ ὁδός" (pronounced: he hodos). This phrase is notable in the New Testament, particularly in Acts, where it is used to refer to the early Christian community and their way of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is an extraordinary conception of the Lord Jesus Christ as a corporate, more-than-individual personality. Christians, from the beginning found themselves driven to an estimate of Jesus in more than merely individual terms. A way to approach this is to consider the significance of the term “in Christ” (and related formulae) in the thinking of Paul. Then, it makes sense to show that the estimate of Jesus, which it implies, was entertained, at least by implication, by other early Christians besides Paul.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose you start by simply counting New Testament occurrences of ἐν followed by a designation of Jesus (e.g., Christ, the Lord, Christ Jesus). In that case, the vast preponderance is in the Pauline epistles. Elsewhere, it is much less frequent and does not occur in Hebrews, James, II Peter, or Jude. But if you ask how often it refers to <em>incorporation in Christ</em>, the number, even in the Paulines, is considerably reduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, the ἐν might be in the sense of “instrument” or “agent.” Consider the phrase “sanctified by Christ Jesus” (1 Corinthians 1:2). Greek: ἡγιασμένοις ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ (hēgiasmenois en Christō Iēsou). Or consider “God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:19). Greek: ὡς ὅτι θεὸς ἦν ἐν Χριστῷ κόσμον καταλλάσσων ἑαυτῷ (hōs hoti theos ēn en Christō kosmon katallassōn heautō). Although here, “God” is the subject. Likewise, consider “seeking to be justified by Christ” (Galatians 2:17). Greek: ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ (zētountes dikaiōthēnai en Christō). These verses show instances of ἐν that don't necessarily need to be considered incorporative. Yet there is at the least a residuum of occurrences where it unmistakably describes the <em>incorporation of believers in Christ</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider “There is no condemnation for those who are united with Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1). Greek: Οὐδὲν ἄρα νῦν κατάκριμα τοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ (Ouden ara nyn katakrima tois en Christō Iēsou). Or “...who...came to be in Christ” (Romans 16:7). Greek: ...ὃς...γέγονεν ἐν Χριστῷ (hos gegonen en Christō). Or “Finding myself incorporate in him” (Philemon 3:8). Greek: εὑρεθεὶς ἐν αὐτῷ (heuretheis en autō). It is clear enough that at least this group of occurrences &mdash; if not many other less clearly definable uses of ἐν &mdash; reflects a conviction that Christ is an <em>inclusive personality</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, the concept of “in Christ'' in the writings of Paul is indeed significant but perhaps not overwhelming. To the extent it exists, the theme in Pauline theology reflects the idea of believers being spiritually united or incorporated into Christ. This notion goes beyond a simple association; it implies a profound union with Christ with transformative implications.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Paul uses phrases like “in Christ” or “in Christ Jesus,” he often refers to the believers' identification with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. It signifies a close relationship, suggesting that believers share the benefits of Christ's redemptive work. This could be likened to members of a body being interconnected and deriving their identity and function from their connection to the head. Incorporation in Christ becomes a metaphor for a deep, communal relationship with spiritual implications. It's not just about following a set of teachings but about being fundamentally united with Christ and the community of believers.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is perfectly true, of course, that occasionally Christ is spoken of as, conversely, in the believer. If the instances were equally balanced in either direction &mdash; Paul in Christ and Christ in Paul &mdash; we might be inclined to explain the ἐν Χριστῷ of Paul as indicating not a corporate personality but simply one side of the mutual interpenetration of two individuals in an intimate relationship. This is the probable meaning of the Johannine usage of this ἐν. But in Paul, the 'Christ in us' formula is decidedly rare. We may at once discount two instances where it probably means not 'in' but 'among.' One is 2 Corinthians 13.5 (“Jesus Christ is among you”) and Colossians 1.27 (“Christ is among you”). A third, Galatians 4.19, is ambiguous. Here we read, “My little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!” Greek: τεκνία μου οὓς πάλιν ὠδίνω ἄχρις οὗ μορφωθῇ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν (teknia mou hous palin ōdinō achris hou morphōthē Christos en hymin). Here, the “until Christ is formed in you” can be rendered “until you take the shape of Christ.” Another interesting one is Colossians 3.1: “Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.” Greek: ὅπου οὐκ ἔνι Ἕλλην καὶ Ἰουδαῖος, περιτομὴ καὶ ἀκροβυστία, βάρβαρος, Σκύθης, δοῦλος, ἐλεύθερος, ἀλλὰ τὰ πάντα καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν Χριστός (hopou ouk eni Hellēn kai Ioudaios, peritomē kai akrobustia, barbaros, Skythēs, doulos, eleutheros, alla ta panta kai en pasin Christos).
      </p>

      <p>
        Romans 8:10 is worth considering in this regard: “But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.” Greek: εἰ δὲ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν, τὸ μὲν σῶμα νεκρὸν διὰ ἁμαρτίαν, τὸ δὲ πνεῦμα ζωὴ διὰ δικαιοσύνην (ei de Christos en hymin, to men sōma nekron dia hamartian, to de pneuma zōē dia dikaiosynēn).
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of these usages perhaps means that, while Paul could freely speak of the Christian not only living and acting but being and existing “in Christ” when it came to the converse &mdash; Christ in us &mdash; he tended to think not of Christ incorporate in the believer but rather of Christ 'at work', or 'living his life' in the believers. But there do seem to be exceptions. Consider Ephesians 3.17: “so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith — that you, being rooted and grounded in love.” Greek: ἵνα κατοικήσῃ τὸν Χριστὸν διὰ τῆς πίστεως ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν, ἐν ἀγάπῃ ἐρριζωμένοι καὶ τεθεμελιωμένοι.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here 'Dwelling in your hearts' is, of course, much the same as 'being in you', ... ἐν ὑμῖν, and is undeniably individual. Then consider Galatians. 2.20, which is, admittedly, a signal and most remarkably reciprocal phrase. “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” Greek: Χριστῷ συνεσταυρώμαι· ζῶ δὲ οὐκέτι ἐγώ, ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμοὶ Χριστός· ὃ δὲ νῦν ζῶ ἐν σαρκί, ἐν πίστει ζῶ τῇ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἀγαπήσαντός με καὶ παραδόντος ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arguably, 'the life which Christ lives in me' is tantamount to 'Christ is in me.' But apart from these, there is a strong tendency to speak only of Christ's <em>activity</em>, rather than <em>existence</em>, in us.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the "we in Christ" formula, Christians are envisioned as having their fundamental location, existence, and status rooted in Christ. It suggests a profound connection where believers derive their identity and purpose from being in Christ. This is more than a reciprocal relationship; it's a foundational concept where being "in Christ" is central to the Christian experience. On the other hand, Moule notes that Christ is not as frequently spoken of as existing in Christians in a correlative manner. While there may be some reciprocity regarding Christians working in Christ and God/Christ working in Christians, the emphasis seems to be on the believers' incorporation into Christ rather than Christ's existence in them. This perspective aligns with the theological understanding of believers participating in the life of Christ, sharing in his redemptive work, and being part of a larger spiritual reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        So let's consider Χριστὸν (“Christ”) and Κύριος or κύριον (“Lord”). "Κύριος" (Kurios) and "κύριον" (kurion) are related words. They both stem from the same root, which is "κύριος" (kurios). Certain subtle differences may be detected in the ἐν phrases with these terms. Very roughly speaking and without complete consistency, the Χριστὸν-phrases tend to be indicative, 'kerygmatic' statements relating to the work of God and to what, in Christ, Christians <em>are</em>; the Κύριος-phrases tend to be imperative, ethical exhortations, urging Christians to <em>become</em> what they are. Consider Colossians 2:6 in both English and Greek: “Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,” Greek: ὥσπερ οὖν παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν τὸν κύριον, ἐν αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε. The formulae could be summed up and combined as "Become, <em>in the Lord</em>, what you already are <em>in Christ</em>!"

        All this (arguably) adds up to, not a proof but at least a strong indication, that although Paul viewed the Lord Jesus Christ as one who had indeed direct relations with each Christian, he did not view him as a mere individual, but rather as an inclusive personality: one in whom Christians are incorporated by baptism.

        Moule's observation aligns with the idea of a corporate or supra-individual understanding of Christ in Pauline theology. Instead of viewing Christ merely as an individual, Paul emphasizes Christ as an inclusive personality, incorporating believers into a larger, collective identity. The act of baptism, as mentioned by Moule, becomes a symbolic and transformative moment where individuals are not just individually associated with Christ but are immersed into a communal identity “in Christ.” It's like being part of a larger body or community, transcending individuality and emphasizing a shared life and purpose. This corporate notion of Christ reflects a broader understanding of salvation and spiritual life within the Christian community. It's not just about individual believers having a personal relationship with Christ; it's about being part of a collective body, with Christ as the unifying force that brings believers together.
