      <h1>The Phenomenon of the New Testament</h1>

      <p>
        This book is subtitled <em>An Inquiry into the Implications of Certain Features of the New Testament</em>, written by Charles Francis Digby "Charlie" Moule (known professionally as C.F.D. Moule), and published in 1967. The book is part of the <em>Studies in Biblical Theology</em> (Second Series 1), which is a series of monographs designed to provide clergy and laymen with the best work in biblical scholarship.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contents of the book are part of The David S. Schaff Lectures, specifically from a series of five lectures presented on 18-22 April 1966 at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. These lectures were in turn based on previous lectures from 1962 in the Queen's University of Belfast. The contents of Appendix 1 were originally published in 1952 and the contents of Appendix 2 were originally published in 1959.

        A key question being asked is the following: Is Christianity based on insufficient evidence?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        What does apologetic imply about the nature of history in relation to Christian faith? Is not Christian faith something that not only does not need to defend itself, but by definition cannot begin to produce evidence without ceasing to be faith?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This gets into the idea of trying to "prove Christianity," in the broad sense, one method of which has been the "Life of Jesus" research of the so-called "questors" for the "Historical Jesus."
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Von Reimarus zu Wrede</em> is a book written by Albert Schweitzer, published in 1906. The English translation of the title is "From Reimarus to Wrede." In this work, Schweitzer examines the historical quest for the historical Jesus and critiques various scholars' approaches and interpretations during the 18th and 19th centuries. Schweitzer's book is particularly known for its significant impact on the study of the historical Jesus. He argued that many scholars of his time had projected their own views onto Jesus, creating a "Jesus in their own image." Schweitzer's own view was that Jesus was an eschatological figure who expected the imminent end of the world, and he emphasized the need for a historical understanding that considered the context of Jesus' time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before even that, Martin Kähler's work, <em>Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus</em> (translated as "The So-Called Historical Jesus and the Historical, Biblical Christ" in 1964 by C.E. Braaten), was published in 1892. In this book, Kähler also contributed to the discussions about the quest for the historical Jesus. Kähler's central argument was that the New Testament presented not just a historical Jesus but a Christ of faith, emphasizing the importance of the theological understanding of Christ as portrayed in the biblical narrative. He cautioned against trying to separate the historical Jesus from the Christ of faith, arguing that the significance of Jesus should be understood within the context of Christian belief.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider that Karl Barth, a prominent Swiss Reformed theologian, made the statement that "apologetics is the death of theology." Barth was critical of traditional apologetics, which aims to defend and justify religious beliefs through rational arguments. He believed that relying too much on human reason in defending faith could undermine the essence of theology, which, for him, should be centered on the revelation of God rather than human attempts to prove or justify it. Barth's perspective reflects his emphasis on the primacy of divine revelation and the limitations of human understanding in grasping the mysteries of faith.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I therefore unashamedly address myself to those who are prepared to allow to historical evidence a place in the considerations leading up to faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Can we find phenomena undeniably attested by the New Testament? If so, we can then ask how we propose to account for those phenomena. What account can we provide to give of the processes leading to the phenomena? Essentially we're asking for the interpretation of facts and, even more specifically, what is the most plausible interpretation? On that point, D.E. Jenkins, in the 1965 <em>Jesus and God</em> says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christianity is based on indisputable facts .... I do not say that Christianity is the indisputable interpretation of these facts.
      </blockquote>

        There was an interesting review, in the London <em>Times</em> on 10 February 1966. This review was of C. S. Lewis' <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> (first published in 1942). The review says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        If Screwtape had read a later theology he would hardly have been afraid of humanity's <em>reasoning</em> itself into faith. An existentialist devil would have attacked not his victim's rationality, but his power of choice, his capacity for taking the leap. Or have persuaded his prey into a systematic, rational belief only to subvert it with the terrifying actuality of the absurd. But Screwtape seems to have been convinced by Chesterton — too easily it may seem to a later generation. . . . Screwtape, like so many apologists, is preaching only to the converted.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It's an interesting statement so let's pick it apart. The review suggests that Screwtape, the demonic protagonist, is overly concerned with humans reasoning themselves into faith. This, according to the reviewer, is a somewhat outdated perspective. The reviewer proposes an alternative strategy for a demon, drawing from the philosophy of existentialism. This approach would focus on attacking the human's freedom of choice and their ability to commit to faith (taking the leap). Another tactic suggested in the review involves encouraging the human to adopt a rational, systematic belief system only to undermine it later with the "terrifying actuality of the absurd." This implies exploiting the inherent contradictions and meaninglessness that the reviewer associates with existentialism.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reviewer suggests that Screwtape's arguments resemble those of Christian apologists, who are seen as primarily preaching to those already convinced. The implication is that Screwtape's tactics are ineffective for a modern audience, particularly those raised with a more nuanced understanding of faith and reason. The reviewer acknowledges that Screwtape's approach might seem "too easy" to a "later generation," implying a shift in how people approach faith and temptation in the years since the book's publication.
      </p>

        Of this review's idea, Moule says: "Rational conviction, even when it can be had, is very different from commitment." He quotes Walter Künneth from his book <em>The Theology of the Resurrection</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Christological question does not arise in the sphere of history pure and simple, but on its frontier, inasmuch as in the fact of Christ there emerges something absolutely unconditional, which is accessible only to faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Moule then asks us to compare that sentiment with one by Alan Richardson in his book <em>History Sacred and Profane</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christian theology has never suggested that the 'fact' of Christ's resurrection could be known apart from faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So what Moule is saying is that being committed to Christ is not purely an intellectual endeavor. While intellectual conviction may play some part, it most certainly is not the only part. Yet it is important. As Moule says, that committment "can never be achieved in defiance of the intellect."
      </p>

      <p>
        In looking at various reasons that some dismiss Christianity, usually based ultimately on psychological grounds, Moule says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Christianity, on this showing, is to be explained by sincerely believed delusions, reinforced (we must add) by the comfort and security-value of so reassuring a faith. For good value, one can throw in the observation that it was coupled also with a great deal of moral goodness and warm fellowship which anyone might recognize as genuine, and which helped to lend momentum to the movement and make it attractive.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yet there is harm in this approach. Moule quotes Richard Niebuhr from his <em>Resurrection and Historical Reason</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Those who propound the psychological theories of the resurrection of Jesus usually fail to admit to the monstrous character of the interpretation of history which their theories have inevitably, if inadvertently, created.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yet Moule asks:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        May not Christianity be one more movement precipitated by a delusion but kept going by certain general, permanent truths and virtues?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Moule further says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        No Christian is going to deny that many an influential and vigorous movement has begun from a mistaken view of things and has survived and grown and prospered — provided always that the mistake contains enough of truth, or corresponds sufficiently to basic human needs or to the needs of the moment, ot has a leader forceful enough, for it to gain momentum.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Walter Künneth is quoted again:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The primitive Christian message ... did <em>not</em> make general statements about Jesus, but concentrated upon definite happenings, and brought out one singular event as the essential content of faith and as the ground of faith.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This singular event was the resurrection. So if this event was, in fact, a delusion or some type of fraud, Moule says this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        This alleged delusion has got to be strong enough (for they began with nothing else that was distinctive) to launch this 'sect', and tenacious enough to keep up their distinctiveness over against the pious Judaism to which they otherwise belonged.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So what Moule is concentrating on here, more narrowly, is the historian's question: What triggered off the Church in the first instance? As Moule says, this line of inquiry is "independent of, though complementary to, that which concentrates on original eye-witness to the risen Christ and the subsequent confirmation of the fact of the risen Christ throughout the Church's history."
      </p>

      <p>
        Quoting G.E. Ladd from <em>Jesus and the Kingdom</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The one thing which bound them together was their personal relationship to Jesus and his message about the Kingdom of God.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Moule argues that the relationship and the message have little to no meaning without the powerful event of the resurrection.
