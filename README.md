# Enduring Admiration

Enduring Admiration is a mindset that holds the reductionist impulse (understanding how things were made/came to be) in tension with the faith-based orientation (accepting _that_ they are, and _why_ they matter). It's the conviction that historical and critical analysis (Wonder) does not destroy, but refines and deepens, the continuous spiritual awe (Astonishment).

## Basis

Two books have stood out to me:

- _Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds_

This book by Donald Akenson examines the historical and cultural processes by which the Jewish and Christian Scriptures (the Bible) and the Rabbinic Talmuds came into being. It treats them not as a single, static revelation, but as dynamic, invented cultural artifacts that evolved over centuries. This aligns well with my interest in history and archaeology being applied to religious studies.

- _Abiding Astonishment: Psalms, Modernity, and the Making of History_

This work, by Walter Brueggemann, explores the Book of Psalms, focusing on how they can be read as a powerful counter-script to the dominant narratives of modernity. Brueggemann argues that the Psalms offer a way to reimagine history and human experience through modes of "orientation," "disorientation," and "new orientation," which are rooted in a sense of ongoing wonder and faith.

In some ways, the books could not be more different, and yet, both books are brought together by a shared focus on the historical development and cultural impact of key religious texts. They just approach it from different angles. One deals with the invention and formation, and the other with the continued theological and social impact. In both cases, we get astonishment and wonder.

I'm building on that with what I call Enduring Admiration. This is the sustained, intellectually and spiritually cultivated orientation of the self toward the contingent reality of existence and the Divine source from which it continually flows.

### Admiration (The Thomist Anchor)

Instead of just Wonder (which can be fleeting), Admiration grounds the concept in the mind.

- In a Thomist sense, wonder (_admiratio_) is often described as the starting point of philosophy and knowledge; it's the desire for knowledge that is elicited when we encounter an effect whose cause we don't fully know.

- Admiration, in this context, is the active response to encountering something contingent (i.e., something that exists but didn't have to exist). It's the recognition of Being itself as an inexplicable gift. This intellectual response drives a reductionist desire I have: to understand the evidence of existence as much as possible, while accepting the mystery of its ultimate cause.

### Enduring (The Abiding/Surpassing Bridge)

The term Enduring ensures this is a cultivated virtue, not a momentary feeling.

- It connects to "Abiding Astonishment" (Brueggemann), suggesting a continual commitment to seeing the world and history through a lens of faith and surprise, even amid disorientation and suffering.

- It connects to "Surpassing Wonder" (Akenson), by implying that even after you have critically and historically examined the "invention" of sacred texts and stripped away myth, the foundational reality they point to, the very fact that these texts endure and shape civilization, is still a cause for intellectual and spiritual awe.

### A (Rough) Analogy

I frame Enduring Admiration as the relationship between an archaeologist and a magnificent ancient temple.

- Surpassing Wonder = The Process of Excavation and Study

This is the work of separating the historical, cultural, and material layers (the "invention" of the texts). The archaeologist studies the architecture, the tools used, the history of its builders, and the political context of its creation. They admire the ingenuity, _even_ if they find evidence that contradicts popular myth.

- Abiding Astonishment = The Experience of the Temple's Sacred Space

This is the theological/spiritual appreciation. The feeling you get when you step inside, regardless of how it was built. It's the recognition of its enduring _purpose_, its power to orient human life, and its continued presence despite the rise and fall of empires.

- Enduring Admiration	= The Archaeologist-Turned-Worshiper

This is the synthesis. It's the scholar who knows exactly how the temple was constructed, every flaw in the design, and every change made over two millennia, yet still chooses to kneel within it. The factual knowledge does not diminish the spiritual awe; rather, the hard-won knowledge deepens the reverence for the reality that surpassed the mere ingenuity of the builders.
