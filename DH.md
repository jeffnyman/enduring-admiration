# Deuteronomistic History Notes

"When all of the pieces of this survey are pulled together, it appears that we are left with a picture of pan-Deuteronomism of epidemic proportions ... It would seem, then, that we have a basically Deuteronomistic Bible" (Wilson, p. 77-8).

"although a growing number of scholars agree that much of the Hebrew Bible is Deuteronomistic, they do not agree on what makes it Deuteronomistic" (Wilson, p. 78).

In assessing the extent of pan-Deuteronomism, then, it is important to remember the lack of consistent criteria being employed in the discussion, and it is equally important to keep open the possibility that pan-Deuteronomism may be less pervasive than it first appears" (Wilson, p. 80).

"All of the work that I have surveyed, when taken together, provides no coherent account of Deuteronomism as a social, political or religious movement ... it is difficult to see the activities of a specific group working at a specific time and place and having specific interests" (Wilson, p. 81).

"recent research on Deuteronomistic influence can provide no coherent account to indicate _why_ the Deuteronomists engaged in this massive and thorough-going literary enterprise" (Wilson, p. 81).

"if the pan-Deuteronomists are correct in their arguments, then they are suggesting something much more pervasive and complex than the work of a single group, guided by a single rationale and working at a specific time and place" (Wilson, p. 82).

"Recent research may in fact have demonstrated, unwittingly, that the concept of Deuteronomism has become so amorphous that it no longer has any analytical precision and so ought to be abandoned" (Wilson, p. 82).

"Current trends in Deuteronomistic research may thus force scholars to take seriously the possibility that if everybody is the Deuteronomist, then there may be no Deuteronomist at all" (Wilson, p. 82).

"If Deuteronomistic literary activity was as extensive as scholars have suggested, then Deuteronomism may have been a much more diverse and long-lasting movement than commonly thought, although the reason behind all this activity remains unexplained and seems to vary in each case. ... Alternatively, the concept of Deuteronomism had become so amorphous that it should be abandoned. In other words, if everybody is a Deuteronomist, nobody is a Deuteronomist" (McKenzie, 2012, p. 403).

"a reaffirmation of the existence of the Deuteronomistic History and of the distinction between the adjectives “Deuteronomic,” in reference to the original book of Deuteronomy, and “Deuteronomistic,” referring to the authorship or editing of the Former Prophets and probably Jeremiah in its wake" (McKenzie, 2012, p. 406).

"what has become a growing question for a number of scholars, namely that of the very existence of a Deuteronomistic History" (McKenzie, 2012, p. 406).

"The idea of a “Deuteronomistic school” continues to be widely held yet poorly defined" (McKenzie, 2012, p. 407).

"When a word or a concept has taken over so much of our thought it seems only right to pause and explore its appropriate meaning" (Coggins, 1999, p. 23).

"Yet of so wide-ranging and influential a movement there is no external evidence of any kind; the whole history of tradition has to be worked out by inference. Deuteronomistic influence may be traced, but there is still no agreement as to who the Deuteronomists were" (Coggins, 1999, p. 26).

"the question must be asked whether confusion is not being increased by applying the same description to what are essentially different phenomena" (Coggins, 1999, p. 34).

The so-called Deuteronomists were thought to be responsible for Deuteronomy, which seems obvious. They were also responsible for the so-called Deuteronomistic History: Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. Deuteronomists were also, in some cases, thought to be responsible primarily for the non-narrative prose in Jeremiah and, likewise, for Isaiah 36-39, mainly because of the close parallel (almost verbatim, in fact) in 2 Kgs 18-20. The Deuteronomists were even thought to be responsible for small units in Amos and Hosea. Some have even felt that the work of the Deuteronomists is represented in most of the books of the Torah, with a further suggestion being that perhaps they were the compilers, if not the direct authors, of the Torah as it has come down to us. In fact, in some cases, they are credited having a hand in all of the prophetic books as well as large number of the Psalms.

There was a time when the term "Deuteronomy" applied quite simply to the book of that name, while "Deuteronomic" was a term attached to the proposed Pentateuchal source D. In reality, there was little daylight between these terms because, at least in most versions of Pentateuchal scholarly work, D was largely confined to the book of Deuteronomy. Eventually the term "Deuteronomic" came to refer to whatever pertains specifically to the book of Deuteronomy, while "Deuteronomistic" came to refer to the general influence or thought-forms associated with the work of the Deuteronomists.
